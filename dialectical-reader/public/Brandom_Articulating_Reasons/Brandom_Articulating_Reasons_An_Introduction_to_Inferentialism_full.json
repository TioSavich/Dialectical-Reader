Strategic Context: The Nature of the Conceptual  This is a book about the use and content of   concepts.   Its animating thought is that the meanings of linguistic expressions and the con -  tents of intentional states, indeed, awareness itself, should be understood, to begin with, in terms of playing a distinctive kind of role in   reasoning.   The idea of privileging   inference   over   reference   in the order of semantic explanation is introduced and motivated in the first chapter. Subsequent chapters develop that approach by using it to address a variety of philosophically important issues and problems: practical reasoning and the role of normative concepts in the theory of action, perception and the role of assessments of reliability in epistemology, the expressive role distinctive of singu -  lar terms and predicates (which, as subsentential expressions, can -  not play the directly inferential role of premise or conclusion), propositional attitude ascriptions and the representational dimen -  sion of concept use, and the nature of conceptual objectivity. Although the discussion is intended to be intelligible in its own right—in each individual chapter, as well as collectively—it may nonetheless be helpful to step back a bit from the project pursued here and to situate it in the larger context of theoretical issues, possibilities, and approaches within which it takes shape.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n2   ◆   Introduction  The overall topic is the nature of the conceptual as such. This choice already entails certain significant emphases of attention: within the philosophy of mind, on awareness in the sense of  sapience   rather than of mere sentience; within semantics, on specifically   conceptual   content, to the detriment of concern with other sorts of contentfulness; within pragmatics, on singling out   discursive   (that is, concept-using) practice from the back -  ground of various other kinds of skillful doing. The aim is to focus on the conceptual in order to elaborate a relatively clear notion of the kind of   awareness   of something that consists in applying a con -  cept to it—paradigmatically by saying or thinking something about it.  Addressing this topic requires making a series of choices of fun -  damental explanatory strategy. The resulting commitments need to be brought out into the open because they shape any approach to the conceptual in such important ways. Making this back -  ground of orienting commitments explicit serves to place a view in a philosophical space of alternatives. Features of an account that otherwise express nearly invisible (because only implicit) assump -  tions then show up as calling for decisions, which are subject to determinate sorts of challenges and demands for justification. The major axes articulating the region inhabited by the line of thought pursued here can be presented as a series of stark binary opposi -  tions, which collectively make it possible to map the surrounding terrain.  1 .   Assimilation   or   Differentiation   of the Conceptual?  One fork in the methodological road concerns the relative priority accorded to the   continuities   and   dis continuities between dis -  cursive and nondiscursive creatures: the similarities and differ -  ences between the judgments and actions of concept users, on the one hand, and the uptake of environmental information and  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   3  instrumental interventions of non–concept-using organisms and artifacts, on the other. We can ask how sharp this distinction is— that is, to what extent and in what ways the possibility of inter- mediate cases can be made intelligible. And more or less indepen -  dently of the answer to this question, it is possible for theorists to differ as to whether they   start   by describing a common genus and go on to elaborate differentiae (whether qualitative or in terms of some quantitative ordering by a particular kind of com -  plexity), as opposed to beginning with an account of what is dis -  tinctive of the conceptual, which is only later placed in a larger frame encompassing the doings of less capable systems. Of course, wherever the story starts, it will need to account both for the ways in which concept use is like the comportments of non -  discursive creatures and the ways in which it differs. Theories that  assimilate   conceptually structured activity to the nonconceptual activity out of which it arises (in evolutionary, historical, and individual-developmental terms) are in danger of failing to make enough of the difference. Theories that adopt the converse strat -  egy, addressing themselves at the outset to what is   distinctive   of or exceptional about the conceptual, court the danger of not doing justice to generic similarities. The difference in emphasis and order of explanation can express substantive theoretical com -  mitments.  Along this dimension, the story told here falls into the second class:   dis   continuities between the conceptual and non- or precon -  ceptual are to the fore. The discussion is motivated by a concern with what is special about or characteristic of the conceptual as such. I am more interested in what separates concept users from non–concept users than in what unites them. This distinguishes my project from that of many in contemporary semantic theory (for instance, Dretske, Fodor, and Millikan), as well as from the classical American pragmatists, and perhaps from the later Witt -  genstein as well.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n4   ◆   Introduction  2 .   Conceptual   Platonism   or   Pragmatism?  Here is another strategic methodological issue. An account of the conceptual might explain the   use   of concepts in terms of a prior understanding of conceptual   content.   Or it might pursue a com -  plementary explanatory strategy, beginning with a story about the practice or activity of applying concepts, and elaborating on that basis an understanding of conceptual content. The first can be called a   platonist   strategy, and the second a   pragmatist   (in this usage, a species of functionalist) strategy. One variety of semantic or conceptual platonism in this sense would identify the content typically expressed by declarative sentences and possessed by beliefs with sets of possible worlds, or with truth conditions other -  wise specified. At some point it must then explain how associating such content with sentences and beliefs contributes to our under -  standing of how it is proper to use sentences in making claims, and to deploy beliefs in reasoning and guiding action. The pragmatist direction of explanation, by contrast, seeks to explain how the use of linguistic expressions, or the functional role of intentional states, confers conceptual content on them.  The view expounded in these pages is a kind of conceptual pragmatism (broadly, a form of functionalism) in this sense. It offers an account of knowing (or believing, or saying)   that   such and such is the case in terms of knowing   how   (being able) to   do  something. It approaches the contents of conceptually   explicit  propositions or principles from the direction of what is   implicit   in practices of using expressions and acquiring and deploying beliefs. ‘Assertion’, ‘claim’, ‘judgment’, and ‘belief ’ are all systematically ambiguous expressions—and not merely by coincidence. The sort of pragmatism adopted here seeks to explain what is assert ed   by appeal to features of assert ings,   what is claim ed   in terms of claim -  ings,   what is judg ed   by judg ings,   and what is believ ed   by the role of believ ings   (indeed, what is expressed by expressings of it)—in general, the content by the act, rather than the other way around.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   5  3 .   Is   Mind   or   Language   the Fundamental Locus of Intentionality?  Concepts are applied in the realm of   language   by the public use of sentences and other linguistic expressions. They are applied in the realm of   mind   by the private adoption of and rational reliance on beliefs and other intentional states. The philosophical tradition from Descartes to Kant took for granted a   mentalistic   order of explanation that privileged the mind as the native and original locus of concept use, relegating language to a secondary, late -  coming, merely instrumental role in communicating to others thoughts already full-formed in a prior mental arena within the individual. The period since then has been characterized by a growing appreciation of the significance of language for thought and mindedness generally, and a questioning of the picture of lan -  guage as a more or less convenient tool for expressing thoughts intelligible as contentful apart from any consideration of the pos -  sibility of   saying   what one is   thinking.   The twentieth century has been the century of language in philosophical thought, acceler -  ating into something like a reversal of the traditional order of explanation. Thus Dummett defends a   linguistic   theory of inten -  tionality: “We have opposed throughout the view of assertion as the expression of an interior act of judgment; judgment, rather, is the interiorization of the external act of assertion.” 1   Dummett’s claim is emblematic of views (put forward in different forms by thinkers such as Sellars and Geach) that see language use as an -  tecedently and independently intelligible, and so as available to provide a model on the basis of which one could then come to understand   mental   acts   and   occurrences   analogically:   taking thinking as a kind of inner saying. Such a view just turns the classi -  cal early modern approach on its head.  Davidson claims that to be a believer one must be an interpreter of the speech of others, but that “neither language nor thinking can be fully explained in terms of the other, and neither has  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n6   ◆   Introduction  conceptual priority. The two are, indeed, linked in the sense that each requires the other in order to be understood, but the linkage is not so complete that either suffices, even when reasonably re -  inforced, to explicate the other.” 2   Although Davidson shares some important motivations with Dummett’s purely linguistic theory, in fact these two views illustrate an important difference between two ways in which one might give prominence to linguis -  tic practice in thinking about the use of concepts. Davidson’s claim, by contrast to Dummett’s, serves to epitomize a   relational  view of the significance of language for sapience: taking it that concept use is not intelligible in a context that does not include language use, but not insisting that linguistic practices can be made sense of without appeal at the same time to intentional states such as belief.  The line of thought pursued here is in this sense a   relational lin -  guistic   approach to the conceptual. Concept use is treated as an essentially linguistic affair. Claiming and believing are two sides of one coin—not in the sense that every belief must be asserted nor that every assertion must express a belief, but in the sense that nei -  ther the activity of believing nor that of asserting can be made sense of independently of the other, and that their conceptual contents are essentially, and not just accidentally, capable of being the con -  tents indifferently of both claims and beliefs. In the context of the commitment to the kind of explanatory relation between those activities and those contents mentioned above, this approach takes the form of a linguistic pragmatism that might take as its slogan Sellars’s principle that   grasping a concept is mastering the use of a word.   James and Dewey were pragmatists in the sense I have picked out, since they try to understand conceptual content in terms of practices of using concepts. But, in line with their generally assimi -  lationist approach to concept use, they were not specifically   lin -  guistic   pragmatists. The later Wittgenstein, Quine, and Sellars (as well as Dummett and Davidson) are linguistic pragmatists, whose strategy of coming at the meaning of expressions by considering  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   7  their use provides a counterbalance to the Frege-Russell-Carnap- Tarski platonistic model-theoretic approach to meaning.  4 .   The Genus of Conceptual Activity:  Representation   or   Expression?  Besides this issue about the original   locus   of the conceptual, there is an issue about how to understand the   genus   of which it is a species. (As I have indicated, this is no less urgent for theories that concern themselves in the first instance with what is distinctive of the conceptual species of that genus than it is for those adopt -  ing the assimilationist order of proceeding.) The master concept of Enlightenment epistemology and semantics, at least since Descartes, was   representation.   Awareness was understood in rep -  resentational terms—whether taking the form of direct awareness of representings or of indirect awareness of representeds via repre -  sentations of them. Typically, specifically conceptual representa -  tions were taken to be just one kind of representation of which and by means of which we can be aware. This orienting thought remains active to this day, surviving the quite substantial trans -  formations required, for instance, for naturalistic and broadly functional accounts of awareness by and of representations. The result is a familiar, arguably dominant, contemporary research program: to put in place a general conception of representation, the simpler forms of which are exhibited already in the activity of non–concept-using creatures, and on that basis elaborate ever more complex forms until one reaches something recognizable as specifically   conceptual   representation.  This representational paradigm 3   of what mindedness consists in is sufficiently ubiquitous that it is perhaps not easy to think of alternatives of similar generality and promise. One prominent countertradition, however, looks to the notion of   expression,  rather than representation, for the genus within which distinc -  tively conceptual activity can become intelligible as a species.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n8   ◆   Introduction  To the Enlightenment picture of mind as   mirror,   Romanticism opposed an image of the mind as   lamp. 4   Broadly cognitive activity was to be seen not as a kind of passive reflection but as a kind of active revelation. Emphasizing the importance of experimental intervention and the creative character of theory production motivated an assimilation of scientific to artistic activity, of finding as constrained making—a picture of knowing nature as producing a second nature (to use Leonardo da Vinci’s phrase).  The sort of expressivism Herder initiated takes as its initial point of departure the process by which inner becomes outer when a feeling is expressed by a gesture. 5   We are then invited to consider more complex cases in which attitudes are expressed in actions, for instance, when a desire or intention issues in a corresponding doing, or a belief in saying. So long as we focus on the simplest cases, an expressivist model will not seem to offer a particularly promising avenue for construing the genus of which conceptual activity is a species (though one might say the same of the repre -  sentational model if attention is focused on, say, the imprint of a seal on a wax tablet). But a suitable commentary on the model may be able to repair this impression somewhat.  First, we might think of the process of expression in the more complex and interesting cases as a matter not of transforming what is inner into what is outer but of making   explicit   what is  implicit.   This can be understood in a pragmatist sense of turning something we can initially only   do   into something we can   say:   cod -  ifying some sort of knowing   how   in the form of a knowing   that.  Second, as is suggested by this characterization of a pragmatist form of expressivism, in the cases of most interest in the present context, the notion of explicitness will be a   conceptual   one. The process of explicitation is to be the process of applying concepts: conceptualizing some subject matter. Third, we need not yield to the temptation, offered by the primitive expressive relation of ges -  ture to feeling, to think of what is expressed and the expression of it as individually intelligible independently of consideration of the  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   9  relation between them. At least in the more interesting cases, specification of what is implicit may depend on the possibility of making it explicit. And the explicit may not be specifiable apart from consideration of what is made explicit. On such a view, what is expressed must be understood in terms of the possibility of expressing it. Such a   relational   expressivism will understand lin -  guistic performances and the intentional states they express each as essential elements in a whole that is intelligible only in terms of their relation. According to such an approach, for instance, one ought not to think that one can understand either believing or asserting except by abstracting from their role in the process of asserting what one believes (that is, this sort of expressivism has as a consequence a relational linguistic view of the layout of the con -  ceptual realm).  Understanding the genus of which the conceptual is a species in representational terms invites a platonist order of explanation. That it does not demand one is clear from the possibility of psy -  chologically or linguistically functionalist accounts of representa -  tional content. Nonetheless, expressivism is particularly congenial to a pragmatist order of semantic explanation, as is indicated by the formulation of the relation between what is implicit and what is explicit in terms of the distinction between knowing how and knowing that. The account presented in the body of this work is one kind of constitutive, pragmatist, relationally linguistic, con -  ceptual expressivism. The commitment to trying to make expres -  sivism work as a framework within which to understand concept use and (so) conceptual content sets this project off from most others on the contemporary scene. For a representational para -  digm reigns not only in the whole spectrum of analytically pur -  sued semantics, from model-theoretic, through possible worlds, directly counterfactual, and informational approaches to teleo -  semantic ones, but also in structuralism inheriting the broad outlines of Saussure’s semantics, and even in those later conti -  nental thinkers whose poststructuralism is still so far mired in the  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n1 0   ◆   Introduction  representational paradigm that it can see no other alternative to understanding meaning in terms of signifiers standing for signi -  fieds than to understand it in terms of signifiers standing for other signifiers. Even contemporary forms of pragmatism, which are explicitly motivated by the rejection of platonist forms of the rep -  resentational paradigm, have not embraced or sought to develop an expressivist alternative.  5 .   Distinguishing the Conceptual:  Intensionalism   or   Inferentialism?  I am not in this introduction pretending to argue for any of the methodological commitments I am rehearsing. My aim is to offer a quick sketch of the terrain against the background of which the approach pursued in the body of this work (and at greater length and in greater detail in   Making It Explicit ) takes its characteristic shape—to introduce and place those commitments, rather than so much as to begin to entitle myself to any of them. I said at the out- set that I am particularly interested in what   distinguishes   the con -  ceptual from the nonconceptual. This is not a topic that has attracted as much philosophical attention in contemporary circles as I think it deserves. Insofar as there is a consensus answer abroad, I think it must be that the conceptual (or the intentional) is distinguished by a special sort of inten s ionality: intersubstitution of coreferential or coextensional expressions or concepts does not preserve the content of ascriptions of intentional states, paradig -  matically propositional attitudes such as thought and belief. (This is a datum that is relatively independent of how that content is construed, whether in representational terms of truth conditions or of propositions as sets of possible worlds, or as functional roles of some sort, in information-theoretic terms, assertibility condi -  tions, and so on.) Quite a different approach is pursued here.  The master idea that animates and orients this enterprise is that what distinguishes specifically   discursive   practices from the doings  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   1 1  of non–concept-using creatures is their   inferential   articulation. To talk about concepts is to talk about roles in reasoning. The original Romantic expressivists were (like the pragmatists, both classical and contemporary)   assimilationists   about the conceptual. My way of working out an expressivist approach is   exceptionalist,  focusing on the differentiae distinctive of the conceptual as such. It is a   rationalist   pragmatism, in giving pride of place to practices of giving and asking for reasons, understanding them as confer -  ring conceptual content on performances, expressions, and states suitably caught up in those practices. In this way it differs from the view of other prominent theorists who are pragmatists in the sense of subscribing to use theorists of meaning such as Dewey, Heideg -  ger, Wittgenstein, Dummett, and Quine. And it is a rationalist expressivism in that it understands   expressing   something, making it   explicit,   as putting it in a form in which it can both serve as and stand in need of   reasons:   a form in which it can serve as both premise and conclusion in   inferences.   Saying or thinking   that  things are thus-and-so is undertaking a distinctive kind of   inferen -  tially   articulated commitment: putting it forward as a fit premise for further inferences, that is,   authorizing   its use as such a premise, and undertaking   responsibility   to entitle oneself to that commit -  ment, to vindicate one’s authority, under suitable circumstances, paradigmatically by exhibiting it as the conclusion of an inference from other such commitments to which one is or can become entitled. Grasping the   concept   that is applied in such a making explicit is mastering its   inferential   use: knowing (in the practical sense of being able to distinguish, a kind of knowing   how ) what else one would be committing oneself to by applying the concept, what would entitle one to do so, and what would preclude such entitlement.  What might be thought of as Frege’s fundamental   pragmatic  principle is that in   asserting   a claim, one is committing oneself to its   truth.   The standard way of exploiting this principle is a platon -  ist one: some grip on the concept of   truth   derived from one’s  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n1 2   ◆   Introduction  semantic theory is assumed, and an account of the pragmatic force or speech act of assertion is elaborated based on this connection. But the principle can be exploited in more than one way, and lin -  guistic pragmatism reverses the platonist order of explanation. Starting with an account of what one is   doing   in making a claim, it seeks to elaborate from it an account of what is   said,   the con -  tent or proposition—something that can be thought of in terms of truth conditions—to which one commits oneself by such a speech act.  What might be thought of as Frege’s fundamental   semantic  principle   is   that   a   good   inference   never   leads   from   a   true claim(able) to one that is not true. It, too, can be exploited in either of two reductive orders of explanation. 6   The standard way is to assume that one has a prior grip on the notion of truth, and use it to explain what good inference consists in. Rationalist or infer -  entialist pragmatism reverses this order of explanation also. It starts with a practical distinction between good and bad infer -  ences, understood as a distinction between appropriate and inap -  propriate   doings,   and goes on to understand talk about truth as talk about what is preserved by the good moves.  6 .   Bottom-up   or   Top-down   Semantic Explanation?  According to such an inferentialist line of thought, the fundamen -  tal form of the conceptual is the   propositional,   and the core of con -  cept use is applying concepts in propositionally contentful   asser -  tions, beliefs,   and   thoughts.   It claims that to be propositionally contentful is to be able to play the basic inferential roles of both premise and conclusion in inferences. Demarcating the concep -  tual realm by appeal to inference accordingly involves coming down firmly on one side of another abstract methodological divide. For it entails treating the sort of conceptual content that is expressed by whole declarative sentences as prior in the order of explanation to the sort of content that is expressed by subsenten-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   1 3  tial expressions such as singular terms and predicates. Traditional term logics built up from below, offering first accounts of the meanings of the concepts associated with singular and general terms (in a nominalistic representational way: in terms of what they name or stand for), then of   judgments   constructed by relat -  ing those terms, and finally of proprieties of   inferences   relating those judgments. This order of explanation is still typical of con -  temporary representational approaches to semantics (paradigmat -  ically Tarskian model-theoretic ones). There are, however, platon -  istic representational semantic theories that begin by assigning semantic interpretants (for instance, sets of possible worlds) to declarative sentences. Pragmatist semantic theories typically adopt a top-down approach because they start from the   use   of concepts, and what one does with concepts is apply them in judgment and action. Thus Kant takes the judgment to be the minimal unit of experience (and so of awareness in his discursive sense) because it is the first element in the traditional logical hierarchy that one can take   responsibility   for. (Naming is not a doing that makes one  answerable   to anything.) Frege starts with judgeable conceptual contents because that is what pragmatic   force   can attach to. And Wittgenstein’s focus on use leads him to privilege sentences as bits of language the utterance of which can make a move in a language game. I take these to be three ways of making essentially the same pragmatist point about the priority of the propositional. Again, the connection between propositionalism and pragmatism in the broad sense of approaching meaning from the side of use is not a coercive one, since a functionalist version of this approach might privilege contents associated with subsentential expressions. Infer -  entialism, however, is an essentially propositional doctrine.  In this respect, inferentialism and expressivism dovetail neatly. For the paradigm of expression is   saying   something. And what can play the role of premise and conclusion of inference is a saying in the sense of a   claiming.   Expressivism, like inferentialism, directs our attention in the first place to   propositional   conceptual contents. A  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n1 4   ◆   Introduction  further story must then be told about the   de composition of such contents into the sort of conceptual contents that are expressed (in a derivative sense) by subsentential expressions such as singular terms and predicates. (And about their subsequent   re composition to produce novel contents. Such a story is presented in Chap -  ter   4 .) Representationalism, by contrast, is motivated by a designa -  tional paradigm: the relation of a name to its bearer. In one standard way of pursuing this direction of explanation, one must then introduce a special ontological category of states of affairs, thought of as being represented by declarative sentences in some -  thing like the same way that objects are represented by singular terms.  Rationalist   expressivism understands the explicit (the sayable in the sense of claimable, the form something must be in to count as having been expressed) in terms of its inferential role. Coupled with a linguistic pragmatism, such a view entails that practices of giving and asking for reasons have a privileged, indeed defining, role with respect to linguistic practice generally. What makes something a specifically   linguistic   (and therefore, according to this view, discursive) practice is that it accords some performances the force or significance of   claimings,   of   propositionally   contentful commitments, which can both serve as and stand in need of rea -  sons. Practices that do not involve reasoning are not linguistic or (therefore) discursive practices. Thus the ‘Slab’   Sprachspiel   that Wittgenstein introduces in the opening sections of the   Philosophi -  cal Investigations   should not, by these standards of demarcation, count as a genuine   Sprach   spiel. It is a   vocal   but not yet a   verbal  practice. By contrast to Wittgenstein, the inferential identification of the conceptual claims that language (discursive practice) has a  center;   it is not a motley. Inferential practices of producing and consuming   reasons   are   downtown   in the region of linguistic prac -  tice. Suburban linguistic practices utilize and depend on the con -  ceptual contents forged in the game of giving and asking for reasons, are parasitic on it. Claiming, being able to justify one’s  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   1 5  claims, and using one’s claims to justify other claims and actions are not just one among other sets of things one can do with lan -  guage. They are not on a par with other ‘games’ one can play. They are what in the first place make possible talking, and there -  fore thinking: sapience in general. Of course we do   many   other things as concept users besides applying concepts in judgment and action and justifying those applications. But (by contrast to the indiscriminately egalitarian picture presented by contemporary neo-Romantic theorists such as Derrida) according to this sort of semantic rationalism, those sophisticated, latecoming linguistic and more generally discursive activities are intelligible in principle only against the background of the core practices of inference -  and-assertion.  7 .   Atomism   or   Holism ?  Closely related to the issue of top-down or bottom-up semantic explanation is the issue of semantic   holism   versus semantic   atom -  ism.   The tradition of formal semantics has been resolutely atom -  istic, in the sense that the assignment of a semantic interpretant to one element (say, a proper name) is taken to be intelligible inde -  pendently of the assignment of semantic interpretants to any other elements (for instance, predicates or other proper names). One does not need to know anything about what other dots rep -  resent, or what blue wavy lines represent, in order to understand that a particular dot stands for Cleveland on a map. The task of formal semantics is the bottom-up one of explaining how seman -  tically relevant whatsits can systematically be assigned to complex expressions, given that they have been assigned already to simple ones. Atomism adds that the assignments to the simple ones can be done one by one. By contrast, inferentialist semantics is res -  olutely   holist.   On an inferentialist account of conceptual con -  tent, one cannot have   any   concepts unless one has   many   concepts. For the content of each concept is articulated by its inferential  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n1 6   ◆   Introduction  relations to   other   concepts. Concepts, then, must come in pack -  ages (though it does not yet follow that they must come in just one great big one). Conceptual holism is not a commitment that one might be motivated to undertake independently of the con -  siderations that lead one to an inferential conception of the conceptual. It is rather a straightforward consequence of that approach.  8 .   Traditional   or   Rationalist   Expressivism?  The heart of any expressivist theory is of course its account of expressing. What is expressed appears in two forms, as implicit (only potentially expressible) and explicit (actually expressed). To talk of expression is to talk about a process of transformation of what in virtue of its role in that process becomes visible as a   con -  tent   that appears in two   forms,   as implicit and then as explicit. As I indicated above, traditional Romantic expressivism took as its par -  adigm something like the relationship between an inner   feeling  expressed by an outer   gesture.   The   rationalist expressivism   in -  forming the present account is quite different. Where, as here, explicitness is identified with specifically   conceptual   articulation, expressing something is   conceptualizing   it: putting it into concep -  tual form. I said at the outset that the goal of the enterprise is a clear account of sapient awareness, of the sense in which being aware of something is bringing it under a concept. On the approach pursued here, doing that is making a claim or judgment about what one is (thereby) aware of, forming a belief about it— in general, addressing it in a form that can serve as and stand in need of reasons, making it   inferentially   significant. The image of conceptualizing the unconceptualized is a familiar focus of philo -  sophical attention, and it has given rise to a familiar panoply of philosophical pathologies. The rationalist expressivist course pur -  sued here is distinguished by the particular strategy it employs for understanding the relation between the merely implicit and the conceptually explicit.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   1 7  That strategy depends on a constellation of related inferentialist ideas. The first and most fundamental idea, already mentioned above, is a way of thinking about conceptual explicitness. To be explicit in the conceptual sense is to play a specifically   inferential  role. In the most basic case, it is to be   propositionally   contentful in the sense of being fit to serve both as a premise and as a conclusion in inferences. According to the relational linguistic view, to be thinkable or believable in this sense is to be   assertible.   The basic way of working out the pragmatist explanatory strategy is to understand   saying   (thinking, believing . . . )   that   such and such (that is, adopting a   propositionally contentful   attitude) in terms of a distinctive kind of knowing   how   or being able to   do   something. Inferentialism picks out the relevant sort of doing by its   inferen -  tial   articulation. Propositional (and more generally conceptual) contents become available to those engaging in linguistic prac -  tices, whose core is drawing conclusions and offering justifica -  tions. Merely reliably responding differentially to red things is not yet being   aware   of them   as   red. Discrimination by producing repeatable responses (as a machine or a pigeon might do) sorts the eliciting stimuli, and in that sense classifies them. But it is not yet  conceptual   classification, and so involves no awareness of the sort under investigation here. (If instead of teaching a pigeon to peck one button rather than another under appropriate sensory stimu -  lation, we teach a parrot to utter one noise rather than another, we get only to the vocal, not yet to the verbal.) As a next stage, we might imagine a normative practice, according to which red things are   appropriately   responded to by making a certain noise. That would still not be a conceptual matter. What is   implicit   in that sort of practical doing becomes   explicit   in the application of the   concept red   when that responsive capacity or skill is put into a larger context that includes treating the responses as inferentially significant: as providing reasons for making other moves in the language game, and as themselves potentially standing in need of reasons that could be provided by making still other moves. The first advantage that this rationalist pragmatism claims over earlier  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n1 8   ◆   Introduction  forms of expressivism is provided by this relatively clear inferential notion of conceptual explicitness.  Pragmatism about the conceptual seeks to understand what it is explicitly to   say   or   think that   something is the case in terms of what one must implicitly know   how   (be able) to   do.   That the rele -  vant sort of doing is a constellation of asserting and inferring, making claims and giving and asking for reasons for them, is the essence of rationalist or inferentialist pragmatism about the conceptual. But once such an inferential notion of explicitness (propositional or, more generally, conceptual contentfulness) has been put in place, we can appeal to this notion of expressing (what is explicit) to understand various senses in which something can be expressed (what is implicit). The inferentialist picture actually puts in play several notions of implicitness. The first is what is made explicit by a claim or becomes explicit in it: a proposition, possible fact, what is said (sayable) or thought or believed. But in another sense we can talk about what still remains implicit in an explicit claim, namely, its inferential consequences. For in the context of a constellation of inferential practices, endorsing or committing oneself to one proposition (claimable) is implicitly endorsing or committing oneself to others which follow from it. Mastery of these inferential connections is the implicit back -  ground against which alone explicit claiming is intelligible. Actu -  ally drawing inferences from an explicit claimable (something that can be said, thought, and so on) is exploring the inferential rela -  tions that articulate its content. Since in   saying   that things are thus-and-so, for instance, that the cloth is red, one is not in the same sense   saying   (making explicit) that it is colored and spatially extended, those consequences count as only implicit. Since they articulate the content of the original saying, they are at least implicit in it. ‘Implicit’ is once again given a relatively clear infer -  ential sense, but one that is distinct from the sense in which the fact that the cloth is red (to which one can reliably respond differ -  entially) is made explicit in the claim. In different but related senses, an explicit claim has implicit in it:  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   1 9  1 .   proprieties governing inferential moves to and from the com -  mitments to the claimable content in question;  2 .   the other claims that are inferential consequences of the first one, according to the practical proprieties mentioned in ( 1 ); and  3 .   the conceptual content of the claim, which is articulated by the inferences in ( 1 ).  These notions of implicitness are direct products of the basic inferential model of explicitness.  9 .   Is the Semantic Task of Logic Epistemological or Expressive?  One standard way to think of logic is as giving us special epistemic access to a kind of truth. Logic is for establishing the truth of cer -  tain kinds of claims, by   proving   them. But logic can also be thought of in expressive terms, as a distinctive set of tools for   say -  ing   something that cannot otherwise be made explicit. Seeing how this can be so depends on making a further move: applying the original model of explicitness to the inferential consequences that are implicit (in the sense just considered) in any explicit claim. According to the inferentialist account of concept use, in making a claim one is implicitly endorsing a set of inferences, which articu -  late its conceptual content. Implicitly endorsing those inferences is a sort of doing. Understanding the conceptual content to which one has committed oneself is a kind of practical mastery: a bit of know-how that consists in being able to discriminate what does and does not follow from the claim, what would be evidence for and against it, and so on. Making explicit that know-how, the inferences one has implicitly endorsed, is putting it in the form of a claim   that   things are thus-and-so. In this case a central expressive resource for doing that is provided by basic   logical   vocabulary. In applying the concept   lion   to Leo, I implicitly commit myself to the applicability of the concept   mammal   to him. If my language is  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n2 0   ◆   Introduction  expressively rich enough to contain   conditionals,   I can say that   if  Leo is a lion,   then   Leo is a mammal. (And if the language is expres -  sively rich enough to include quantificational operators, I can say that if   anything   is a lion, then it is a mammal.) That Cleo is a cephalopod is good (indeed, decisive) evidence that she is not a lion. If my language is expressively rich enough to contain   nega -  tion,   I can make that implicit inferential component articulating the content of the concept   lion   explicit by saying that   if   Cleo is a cephalopod, then Cleo is   not   a mammal.  By saying things like this, by using   logical   vocabulary, I can make explicit the implicit inferential commitments that articulate the content of the concepts I apply in making ordinary explicit claims.   Here   the   original   inferential-propositional   model   of awareness (in the sense of sapience) is applied at a higher level. In the first application, we get an account of   consciousness —for example,   that   Leo is a lion. In the second application we get an account of a kind of semantic   self -consciousness. For in this way we begin to   say   what we are   doing   in   saying   that Leo is a lion. For instance, we make explicit (in the form of a claimable, and so propositional content) that we are committing ourselves thereby to his being a mammal by saying   that   if something is a lion, then it is a mammal. An account along these lines of the expressive role distinctive of logical vocabulary as such is introduced in Chapter   1  of this book. It is applied and extended in subsequent chapters to include such sophisticated locutions as normative vocabulary (in Chapter   2 ) and intentional tropes such as some uses of ‘of ’ and ‘about’ (in Chapter   5 ), which are not usually put in a box with conditionals and negation. Inferentialism about conceptual con -  tent in this way makes possible a new kind of expressivism about logic. Applying the inferential model of explicitness, and so of expression, to the functioning of logical vocabulary provides a proving ground for the model that permits its elaboration at a level of clarity and exactness that has (to say the least) been unusual within the expressivist tradition. Two dimensions along  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   2 1  which philosophical payoffs can be expected from this fact are explored in Chapters   4   and   5 , which present an expressive account of the nature and deduction of the necessity of the use of singular terms (and predicates), and an account of the expressive role char -  acteristic of explicitly intentional and representational vocabulary, respectively.  Conditional claims—and claims formed by the use of logical vocabulary in general, of which the conditional is paradigmatic for the inferentialist—express a kind of semantic self-consciousness because they make explicit the inferential relations, consequences, and contents of ordinary nonlogical claims and concepts. It is pos -  sible to use the model of (partial) logical explicitation of nonlogi -  cal conceptual contents to illuminate certain features of ordinary making explicit in nonlogical claims. For instance, the conceptual content of a concept such as   red   has as a crucial element its   non in -  ferential circumstances of appropriate application (which, recall, are appealed to in the   broadly   inferential notion of content, since in applying the concept, one implicitly endorses the propriety of the inference from the concept’s circumstances of appropri -  ate application to its consequences of application, regardless of whether those circumstances are themselves specified in narrowly inferential terms). Part of the practical skill that forms the implicit background of knowing how against which alone a broadly infer -  entialist semantic theory can explain the practice of explicitly claiming that something is red, then, is the capacity noninferen -  tially to respond appropriately and differentially to red things. Chapter   3   discusses how this part of the implicit background of explicit application of concepts of observables can itself be made explicit, in the logical sense, by first tracking it with a correspond -  ing   reliability inference   and then codifying that inference with a conditional. In inferentialist terms, the reliability inference   concep -  tualizes   the initially nonconceptual capacity to respond differen -  tially to red things. Once it appears in this inferential guise, the aspect of the content of the concept   red   that is still implicit (in  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n2 2   ◆   Introduction  another sense) even when presented in the form of a reliability inference can be made explicit by using a conditional, just as for any other inferentially articulated aspect.  This development of the relation of expression between what is explicit and what is implicit is guided throughout by the funda -  mental idea of demarcating the conceptual by its specifically infer -  ential articulation. At the first stage, that idea yields an un -  derstanding of the end result of making something explicit in a claimable (judgeable, thinkable, believable), that is, propositional content, of the sort expressed by the use of basic declarative sen -  tences. At the second stage, the same inferentialist idea leads to an expressive model of the conceptual role distinctive of logical vocabulary, which serves to make explicit in the form of claimables (paradigmatically, conditional ones) the inferential relations that implicitly articulate the contents of the ordinary nonlogical con -  cepts we use in making things explicit in the sense specified at the first stage. At the third stage, the notion of the expressive relation between what is explicit and what is implicit that was developed at the second stage in connection with the use of distinctively logical concepts is applied to illuminate further the relation between what is explicit in the sense of the first stage and what is made explicit thereby. The result is an account with a structure recognizable as Hegelian: a rationalist, expressivist account of (a kind of ) con -  sciousness (namely, sapient awareness) provides the basis for a cor -  responding account of (a kind of ) self-consciousness (namely, semantic or conceptual self-consciousness), which is then called upon to deepen the original story by providing a model for under -  standing the sort of consciousness with which the account began.  II.   Historical Context: Rationalism, Pragmatism, and Expressivism  At the very center of this account is its   rationalism:   the pride o f  place it gives to specifically   inferential   articulation, to playing   a  role in practices of giving and asking for   reasons.   It provides th e  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   2 3  answer I offer to the question how to demarcate the distinctive realm of the   conceptual.   Specifically   linguistic   practice is picked out (and recognized as discursive) by its incorporation of inferen -  tial-and-assertional practices: attributing and undertaking com -  mitments to the propriety of making certain moves and occupying certain positions whose contents are determined by their places in those practices. The resulting   rationalistic pragmatism   is impor -  tantly different in just this respect from that of other semantic pragmatists such as Dewey, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Quine, and Rorty. Again,   rationalistic expressivism   has important conceptual resources and advantages denied to traditional Romantic expres -  sivism. This version of expressivism offers a framework within which it is possible to do detailed semantic work (the argument presented in Chapter   4   is emblematic). And that same framework makes possible an expressivist approach to   logic,   which provides potentially important new insights—for instance, into the expres -  sive role distinctive of   normative   vocabulary (discussed in Chap -  ter   2 ), and the expressive role distinctive of   intentional   or explic -  itly   representational   vocabulary (discussed in Chapter   5 ).  Empiricism has been the fighting faith and organizing principle of philosophy in the English-speaking world since at least the time of Locke. Its distinctive twentieth-century form, developed by thinkers such as Russell, Carnap, and Quine, joins to the classical insistence on the origin of knowledge in   experience   an emphasis on the crucial cognitive role played by   language   and   logic.   A central goal of this book is to introduce a way of thinking about these lat -  ter topics—and so about meaning, mind, and knowledge—that swings free of the context of empiricist commitments that has shaped discussion within this tradition.  In turning away from empiricism I do not mean to deny that consideration of perceptual practices must play a crucial role in our epistemology and semantics. What might be called   platitudinous empiricism   restricts itself to the observations that without percep -  tual experience we can have no knowledge of contingent matters of fact, and more deeply, that conceptual content is unintelligible  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n2 4   ◆   Introduction  apart from its relation to perceptual experience. 7   These are not controversial claims. (Indeed, I think it is very difficult to find any philosophers who have   ever   disputed them, including the most notorious candidates. But I will not try to support that claim here.) The theoretical and explanatory commitments of philo -  sophically substantial empiricisms go well beyond these platitudes. My main target is the semantic theory that I see as underlying empiricist approaches to meaning, mind, knowledge, and action. Empiricism is a current of thought too broad and multifarious, with too many shifting eddies, backwaters, and side channels, to be confined within the well-defined banks of necessary and suffi -  cient conditions. Its general course, though, is marked out by commitment to grounding theoretical and practical reasoning and concept use in the occurrence of episodes we immediately find ourselves with: sense experiences on the cognitive side, and felt motivations or preferences on the active side. In the forms I find most objectionable, having these experiences is thought of as not requiring the exercise of specifically   conceptual   abilities. It is understood rather as a   pre conceptual capacity shareable with non–concept-using mammals. Its deliverances are accordingly conceived of as available to explain what concept use consists in, and as providing the raw materials conceptual activities work on or with. (Traditional abstractionist and associationist strategies are just particular ways of working out this line of thought; many oth -  ers are possible.)  Classical empiricist philosophy of mind takes immediate per -  ceptual experiences as the paradigm of awareness or conscious -  ness. Classical empiricist epistemology takes as its paradigm of empirical knowledge those same experiences, to which it traces the warrant for and authority of all the rest. As the tradition has developed, it has become clearer that both rest on a more or less explicit semantic picture, according to which the content of expe -  rience, awareness, and knowledge is to be understood in the first instance in   representational   terms: as a matter of what is (or pur-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   2 5  ports to be) represent ed   by some represent ing   states or epi -  sodes. In contemporary incarnations, this notion of representa -  tional content is most often unpacked in terms of what objects, events, or states of affairs actually causally elicited the representa -  tion, or which ones would reliably elicit representations of that kind under various conditions. This way of thinking about the content of empirical knowledge, to begin with perceptual experi -  ence, is then naturally seen to be complemented by a philosophy of language that focuses on reference, denotation, and extension, following the pattern of extensional model-theoretic semantics for the language of first-order predicate logic.  Empiricism attempts to understand the content of concepts in terms of the origin of empirical beliefs in experience that we just find ourselves with, and the origin of practical intentions in desires or preferences that in the most basic case we just find ourselves with. The   rationalist   order of explanation understands concepts as norms determining what counts as a   reason   for particular beliefs, claims, and intentions, whose content is articulated by the applica -  tion of those concepts and which such statuses can be reasons for. Its impetus is a classically rationalist thought, which Sellars (in an autobiographical sketch) says motivated his philosophical devel -  opment starting already in the   1930 s: the thought that “what was needed was a functional theory of concepts which would make their role in reasoning, rather than supposed origin in experience, their primary feature.” 8   The difference is most telling when we ask about the relation between awareness and concept use. The em -  piricist understands concept use as an achievement to be under -  stood against the background of a prior sort of awareness, which justifies or makes appropriate the application of one concept rather than another. To play this latter role, the awareness in question must amount to something more than just the reliable differential responsiveness of merely irritable devices such as land mines and pressure plates that open doors in supermarkets. For the rational -  ist, on the contrary, awareness of the sort that has a potentially  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n2 6   ◆   Introduction  normative significance (the genus of which cognitive significance is a species) consists in the application of concepts. One must already have concepts to be aware in this sense. Of course, this immediately raises the question how one could come to be a con -  cept user unless one could already be aware of things. But to this a pragmatist such as Sellars can reply with a story about how initially merely differentially responsive creatures can be initiated into the implicitly normative social practice of giving and asking for rea -  sons, so that some of their responses can come to count as or have the social significance of endorsements, of the making or staking of inferentially articulated   claims. 9  Besides rejecting empiricism, the rationalist pragmatism and expressivism presented here is opposed to   naturalism,   at least as that term is usually understood. For it emphasizes what distin -  guishes discursive creatures, as subject to distinctively conceptual norms,   from   their   non–concept-using   ancestors   and   cousins. Conceptual norms are brought into play by social linguistic prac -  tices of giving and asking for reasons, of assessing the propriety of claims and inferences. Products of   social   interactions (in a strict sense that distinguishes them merely from features of popula -  tions) are not studied by the   natural   sciences—though they are not for that reason to be treated as spooky and   super natural. In conferring conceptual content on performances, states, and ex -  pressions suitably caught up in them, those practices institute a realm of   culture   that rests on, but goes beyond, the background of reliable differential responsive dispositions and their exercise char -  acteristic of merely natural creatures. Once concept use is on the scene, a distinction opens up between things that have   natures  and things that have   histories.   Physical things such as electrons and aromatic compounds would be paradigmatic of the first class, while cultural formations such as English Romantic poetry and uses of the terms ‘nature’ and ‘natural’ would be paradigmatic of the second.  The relations between these categories is a complex affair. Phys-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   2 7  ical, chemical, and biological   things   have natures rather than histo -  ries, but what about the disciplines that define and study them? Should physics itself be thought of as something that has a nature, or as something that has a history? Concluding the latter is giving a certain kind of pride of place to the historical, cultural, and con -  ceptual. For it is in effect treating the   distinction   between things that have natures and things that have histories, between things studied by the   Naturwissenschaften   and things studied by the  Geisteswissenschaften,   as itself a cultural formation: the sort of thing that itself has a history rather than a nature. Grasping a con -  cept is mastering the use of a word—and uses of words are a para -  digm of the sort of thing that must be understood historically. In this sense even concepts such as   electron   and   aromatic compound  are the sort of thing that has a history. But they are not   purely   his -  torical. For the proprieties governing the application of those con -  cepts depend on what inferences involving them are   correct,   that is, on what   really   follows from what. And that depends on how things are with electrons and aromatic compounds, not just on what judgments and inferences we endorse. (To say that is to say that our   use   of the corresponding words should not be thought of as restricted to our dispositions to such endorsements.) Under -  standing the relevant sort of dependence—the way what infer -  ences are correct, and so what we are really committing ourselves to by applying them, and so what their contents really are (the contents we have conferred on them by using them as we do), as opposed to what we take them to be—is a delicate and important task. Some essential raw materials for it are assembled in the final three chapters of this book. Chapter   4   offers an account of what it is to talk about   objects.   Chapter   5   tells what it is to take our talk to be   about   objects. And Chapter   6   shows how the structure of rea -  soning makes it possible to understand subjecting our claims to assessments according to a kind of correctness in which authority is invested in the things we are talking about rather than in our attitudes toward them. None of these is a naturalistic account.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n2 8   ◆   Introduction  In addition to rejecting empiricism and embracing nonnatural -  ism, the rationalistic semantic theory introduced here is unu -  sual in not taking   representation   as its fundamental concept. A methodological commitment to beginning an account of concept use (and so, eventually, of conceptual content) with reasoning rather than representing does not require denying that there is an important representational dimension to concept use. Indeed, the unusual explanatory starting point has the advantage of bringing into relief certain features of conceptual representation that are hard to notice otherwise. The final three chapters highlight some of these, while beginning the process of cashing the promissory note issued by an inferentialist order of explanation—that is, offering an account of   referential   relations to objects in terms ulti -  mately of   inferential   relations among claims. Of course,   non infer -  ential language entry moves in perception and language exit moves in action play a crucial role in the story too. But the specifi -  cally   inferential   articulation of the acknowledgments of proposi -  tional commitments that result from observation and result in intentional performances are to the fore in understanding the cognitive and practical   normative   significance of the reliable dif -  ferential responsive capacities exercised in those processes.  I call the view that inferential articulation is a   necessary   element in the demarcation of the conceptual ‘ weak   inferentialism’. The view that inferential articulation   broadly construed   is   sufficient   to account for conceptual content I call ‘ strong   inferentialism’. The view that inferential articulation   narrowly   construed is   sufficient  to account for conceptual content, I call ‘ hyper inferentialism’. The difference between the broad and the narrow construal of inferen -  tial articulation is just whether or not   non inferential circumstances of application (in the case of concepts such as   red   that have nonin -  ferential reporting uses) and consequences of application (in the case of concepts such as   ought   that have noninferential practical uses) are taken into account. The broad sense focuses attention on the inferential commitment that is implicitly undertaken in using  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   2 9  any concept whatever, even those with noninferential circum -  stances or consequences of application: the commitment, namely, to the propriety of the inference from the circumstances to the consequences of application. The view endorsed here is strong inferentialism. 10  Inferentialism of any sort is committed to a certain kind of semantic   holism,   as opposed to the   atomism   that often goes hand in hand with commitment to a representationalist order of seman -  tic explanation. For if the conceptual content expressed by each sentence or word is understood as essentially consisting in its inferential relations (broadly construed) or articulated by its infer -  ential relations (narrowly construed), then one must grasp many such contents in order to grasp any. Such holistic conceptual role approaches to semantics potentially face problems concerning both the   stability   of conceptual contents under change of belief and commitment to the propriety of various inferences, and the possibility of   communication   between individuals who endorse different claims and inferences. Such concerns are rendered much less urgent, however, if one thinks of concepts as   norms   determin -  ing the   correctness   of various moves. The norms I am binding myself to by using the term ‘molybdenum’—what actually follows from or is incompatible with the applicability of the concept— need not change as my views about molybdenum and its inferen -  tial surround change. And you and I may be bound by just the same public linguistic and conceptual norms in the vicinity in spite of the fact that we are disposed to make different claims and infer -  ential moves. It is up to me whether I play a token of the ‘molyb -  denum’ type in the game of giving and asking for reasons. But it is not then up to me what the significance of that move is. (And I do not take the case to be significantly different if I play such a token internally, in thought.)  As I have already remarked, inferentialism also carries with it a commitment to the conceptual primacy of the   propositional.   Thus inferentialism semantic explanations reverse the traditional order:  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n3 0   ◆   Introduction  beginning with proprieties of inference, they explain propositional content, and in terms of both go on to explain the conceptual content expressed by subsentential expressions such as singular terms and predicates. Chapter   4   describes how this last step (which has not been much attended to by recent inferentialists such as Sellars and—on my reading—Dummett) might be accomplished.  The rationalist form of expressivism pursued here also involves rejecting conventional wisdom about the nature and philosophi -  cal significance of   logic.   Logic is not properly understood as the study of a distinctive kind of   formal   inference. It is rather the study of the inferential roles of vocabulary playing a distinctive  expressive   role: codifying in explicit form the inferences that are implicit in the use of ordinary, nonlogical vocabulary. Making explicit the inferential roles of the logical vocabulary then can take the form of presenting patterns of inference involving them that are formally valid in the sense that they are invariant under substi -  tution of nonlogical for nonlogical vocabulary. But that task is subsidiary and instrumental only. The task of logic is in the first instance to help us   say   something about the conceptual contents expressed by the use of nonlogical vocabulary, not to   prove   some -  thing about the conceptual contents expressed by the use of logi -  cal vocabulary. On this picture,   formal   proprieties of inference essentially involving logical vocabulary derive from and must be explained in terms of   material   proprieties of inference essentially involving nonlogical vocabulary rather than the other way around. Logic is accordingly not a canon or standard of right reasoning. It can help us make explicit (and hence available for criticism and transformation) the inferential commitments that govern the use of all our vocabulary, and hence articulate the contents of all our concepts.  Finally, the views presented here turn on their head prevailing humean ideas about practical reasoning. According to this com -  mon approach—which is very much in evidence in Davidson’s writings on action, and of rational-choice theorists and others  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   3 1  who approach the norms of rationality through decision theory or game theory—the norms governing practical reasoning and defin -  ing rational action are essentially   instrumental   norms, which derive their authority from intrinsically motivating preferences or desires. Those states are the empiricist analogs, on the side of agency, to the preconceptual episodes of awareness to which epis -  temic authority is traced on the side of cognition. Chapter   2   offers an account in which statements about what an agent prefers or desires are interpreted instead as codifying commitment to certain specific patterns of practical reasoning, selected from among a wide variety of patterns that are codified by the use of other nor -  mative vocabulary. The concepts of desire and preference are accordingly demoted from their position of privilege, and take their place as having a derivative and provincial sort of normative authority. Endorsement and commitment are at the center of rational agency—as of rationality in general—and inclination enters only insofar as rational agents must bring inclination in the train of rational propriety, not the other way around.  So I am putting forward a view that is opposed to many (if not most) of the large theoretical, explanatory, and strategic commitments that have shaped and motivated Anglo-American philosophy in the twentieth century: empiricism, naturalism, rep -  resentationalism, semantic atomism, formalism about logic, and instrumentalism about the norms of practical rationality. In spite of my disagreements with central elements of the worldview that has animated analytic philosophy, I take my expository and argu -  mentative structure and the criteria of adequacy for having made a claim with a clear content, argued for it, and responsibly followed out its consequences resolutely from the Anglo-American tradi -  tion. I do not think those standards need be taken to entail or be warranted only by this one constellation of ideas. Indeed, although the enterprise I am engaged in here is not happily identi -  fied with   analysis of meanings   in a traditional sense, it is properly thought of as pursuing a recognizable successor project. For what  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n3 2   ◆   Introduction  I am trying to do is in a clear and specific inferential sense make  explicit   what is   implicit   in various philosophically important con -  cepts. Among the examples treated in the following pages are con -  cepts such as   conceptual content, logic, ought, reliable, singular term,   what is expressed by the ‘of ’ or ‘about’ of intentional direct -  edness, and   objectivity.  Sellars once said that the aim of his work as a whole was to begin moving analytic philosophy from its   humean   phase into a   kantian  one. The full implications of this remark include reverberations contributed by many of the chambers and corridors of the Kantian edifice. But at its heart, I think, is the conviction that the distinc -  tive nature, contribution, and significance of the   conceptual   artic -  ulation of thought and action have been systematically slighted by empiricism in all its forms. Although the addition of logic to the mix in the twentieth century was a promising development, there was from Sellars’s point of view a failure to rethink from the beginning the constraints and criteria of adequacy of the enter -  prise in the light of the expressive power the new formal idioms put at our disposal. The result was the pursuit of traditional em -  piricist visions by other means—ones that could not in principle do justice in the end to the normativity of concept use that finds its expression variously in the distinction between laws of nature codifying inferential relations among facts, on the one hand, and mere regularities regarding them, on the other, and in the differ -  ence between acting for a reason and merely moving when prompted. The more promising alternative is to focus to begin with on the conceptual articulation of perceptually acquired and practically pursued commitments and entitlements rather than on the experiences and inclinations with which we simply find our -  selves. That kantian strategy is a better one for the same sort of reasons that lead us to expect that one will learn more about a building by studying blueprints than by studying bricks.  My teacher Richard Rorty has described the enterprise to which this volume is a contribution as an extension of Sellars’s: to make possible a further transition from a   kantian   to a   hegelian   approach  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   3 3  to thought and action. 11   The justice of this characterization can be understood in terms of the strategic options already rehearsed here. First, I am interested in the divide between   nature   and   cul -  ture.   In this context we can identify the realm of the cultural with activities that either consist in the application of concepts in judg -  ment and action or that presuppose such capacities. The   Geistes -  wissenschaften   have as their proper aim the study of concept use and things made possible by it—activities of which only concept users are capable. One of my principal goals is to present and explore the consequences of a particular sort of principle of demarcation for the realm of culture, so understood. Although of course cultural activities arise within the framework of a natural world, I am most concerned with what is made possible by the emergence of the peculiar constellation of conceptually articu -  lated comportments that Hegel called “Geist.” Cultural products and activities become explicit as such only by the use of normative vocabulary that is in principle not reducible to the vocabulary of the natural sciences (though of course the same phenomena under other descriptions are available in that vocabulary). Indeed, the deployment of the vocabulary of the natural sciences (like that of any other vocabulary) is itself a cultural phenomenon, something that becomes intelligible only within the conceptual horizon pro -  vided by the   Geisteswissenschaften.   The study of natures itself has a history, and its own nature, if any, must be approached through the study of that history. This is a picture and an aspiration that we owe to Hegel.  A second dimension of Hegelian influence is his   pragmatism  about conceptual norms. One of Kant’s great insights is that judg -  ments and actions are to be distinguished from the responses of merely natural creatures by their distinctive   normative   status, as things we are in a distinctive sense   responsible   for. He understood  concepts   as the norms that determine just what we have made our -  selves responsible for, what we have committed ourselves to and what would entitle us to it, by particular acts of judging and act -  ing. Kant, however, punted many hard questions about the nature  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n3 4   ◆   Introduction  and origins of this normativity, of the bindingness of concepts, out of the familiar phenomenal realm of experience into the noumenal realm. Hegel brought these issues back to earth by understand -  ing   normative   statuses as   social   statuses—by developing a view according to which (as my colleague John Haugeland put the point in another context) 12   all transcendental constitution is social institution.   The background against which the conceptual activity of making things explicit is intelligible is taken to be implicitly normative essentially   social   practice.  Pragmatism about the norms implicit in cognitive activity came down to us in the first half of the twentieth century from three independent directions: from the classical American pragmatists, culminating in Dewey; from the Heidegger of   Being and Time;  and from the Wittgenstein of the   Philosophical Investigations.   In trying to work out how the insights of these traditions (partly common, partly complementary) could be applied to make prog -  ress within contemporary philosophy of language and philosophy of mind, however, I found myself driven back to Hegel’s original version. For unlike all three of these more recent sorts of social practice theory, Hegel’s is a   rationalist   pragmatism. By contrast to their conceptual assimilationism, he gives pride of place to   reason -  ing   in understanding what it is to say or do something.  Again, Dewey and James, 13   the early Heidegger, and the later Wittgenstein each resisted, in his own way, the   representational  semantic paradigm. But none of them evidently provides an alter -  native paradigm that is structurally rich enough and definite enough either to do real semantic work with—of the sort done by model-theoretic developments of representationalism, including possible worlds semantics 14 —or to provide an account of the dis -  tinctive function of   logical   vocabulary. Hegel’s   rationalistic,   infer -  entialist version of the Romantic   expressivist   tradition he inherited, it seemed to me, holds out the promise of just such an alternative paradigm. Hegel’s version of expressivism is further attractive in that it is not only pragmatic and inferentialist about the concep -  tual but also   relational,   in the sense that the implicit and the  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   3 5  explicit are each at least in part constituted by their expressive rela -  tion to each other. 15   The inferentialist understanding of explicit -  ness is just what is needed to make an expressive alternative to representationalism viable. As I put the point above,   rationalist  expressivism understands the   explicit —the thinkable, the sayable, the form something must be in to count as having been   ex -  pressed —in terms of its role in   inference.   I take Hegel to have introduced this idea, although he takes the minimal unit of con -  ceptual content to be the whole holistic system of inferentially interrelated judgeables, and so is not a propositionalist.  Finally, this rationalist expressivist pragmatism forges a link between   logic   and   self-consciousness,   in the sense of making explicit the implicit background against which alone anything can be made explicit, that is recognizably Hegelian. For it offers an account of a kind of   consciousness,   awareness in the sense of   sapi -  ence,   which underwrites a corresponding account of a kind of   self -  consciousness:   semantic   or   conceptual   self-consciousness. This notion of what is made explicit by the characteristic use of specifi -  cally   logical   vocabulary then makes possible a new appreciation of the sort of consciousness with which the story begins. 16  I think this is a constellation of ideas that has the prospect of enlarging the frontiers of contemporary analytic philosophy. My hope is that by slighting the similarities to animals which preoccu -  pied Locke and Hume and highlighting the possibilities opened up by engaging in social practices of giving and asking for reasons, we will get closer to an account of being human that does justice to the kinds of consciousness and self-consciousness distinctive of us as   cultural,   and not merely   natural,   creatures.  III.   Structure of the Book  The six chapters that make up the body of this work present ideas and arguments drawn from or developing out of my   199 4   book  Making It Explicit.   There is nothing in them that will come as a surprise to anyone who has mastered that work. They were  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n3 6   ◆   Introduction  originally written as lectures, each intended to be intelligible in its own right, apart from its relation to the others. I had in mind audiences that had perhaps not so much as dipped into the big book but were curious about its themes and philosophical conse -  quences. The lectures have been presented individually on many occasions, to many audiences, whose penetrating questions and lively discussion have helped me avoid at least some errors and to groom and streamline the presentations. The lectures were also written with an eye to mutual reinforcement and cumulative effect for those occasions when I was afforded the opportunity for a more extended presentation. I delivered versions of all but one (Chapter   3 , on reliabilism) as the Townsend Lectures at Berkeley in the fall of   1997 , and a different set of five (all but the last) more recently at the Goethe Universität in Frankfurt in the winter of  1999 . The ancestors of Chapters   1 ,   4 , and   5   saw the light of day as my Hempel Lectures at Princeton in the spring of   1994 . 17   I think experience has proven that the stories told in each of these chap -  ters can stand on their own, and that together they give a good picture of some of the argumentative high points of the approach to language and thought developed at length in   Making It Explicit.   Where questions arise about the presuppositions and context of these arguments, however, it should be kept in mind that that work is what should be consulted, and should be consid -  ered as offering the fullest account I can manage—including about the topics put on the table in this introduction. A number of important motivations, commitments, and developments have had to be omitted in this shorter, simpler book.  Chapter   1 , “Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism,” introduces and motivates two basic ideas. The first is that to have specifically   conceptual   content is to play a certain kind of role in  reasoning.   The most basic sort of conceptual content is   proposi -  tional   content: the sort of content expressed by declarative sen -  tences (and the ‘that’ clauses or content-specifying sentential complements of propositional attitude ascriptions). Because con-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   3 7  tents of this sort are the right shape to be sayable, thinkable, and believable, they can be understood as making something   explicit.  The claim is that to have or express a content of this kind just is to be able to play the role both of premise and of conclusion in   infer -  ences.   The second idea is that the expressive role characteristic of  logical   vocabulary as such is to make inferential relations explicit. Thus   conditionals   are treated as paradigms of logical locutions. This line of thought makes sense only if one thinks of proprieties of inference as extending beyond those underwritten by logical form. That is, one must acknowledge that besides inferences that are   formally   good in the sense of being   logically   valid, there are inferences that are   materially   good in the sense of articulating the contents of the   non logical concepts applied in their premises and conclusions.  In the rest of the book these ideas are applied to shed light on a variety of philosophical issues: normativity and practical reasoning in Chapter   2 , the ultimately inferential nature of appeals to the reliability of cognitive processes such as perception in Chapter   3 , how the notion of substitution allows the inferential semantic approach to be extended to subsentential expressions (which can -  not play the direct inferential role of premises and conclusions) such as singular terms and predicates in Chapter   4 , the inferential expressive role characteristic of the locutions that make explicit the   intentional   directedness   or   representational   aboutness   of thought and talk in Chapter   5 , and the sort of social-perspectival, dialogical inferential articulation that makes possible the objectiv -  ity of conceptual content in Chapter   6 .  Chapter   2 , “Action, Norms, and Practical Reasoning,” extends the inferentialist paradigm in logic and semantics to encompass practical reasoning, culminating in noninferential discursive exit transitions in the form of intentional actions. Thus it combines an inferentialist approach to the contents of intentions with the infer -  entialist approach to the content of beliefs. It aims to do three things, corresponding to the three pieces of the title of the chapter:  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n3 8   ◆   Introduction  To explain in inferentialist terms the expressive role that distin -  guishes specifically   normative   vocabulary. That is, to say what  it is the job of such vocabulary to make explicit. Doing this is  saying what ‘ought’ means.  To introduce a non-humean way of thinking about   practical  reasoning.  To offer a broadly kantian account of the   will   as a rational faculty  of practical reasoning.  The empiricist tradition seeks to trace back talk of reasons for ac -  tion and norms governing action to underlying preferences and desires, which are understood both as intrinsically motivating and as the only sorts of things that can be intrinsically motivating. Thus any complete expression of a reason for action must include a specification of what it is that the agent wants, in virtue of which the reason functions (motivationally) as a reason for that agent. In the story told here, by contrast to this instrumentalist one, prefer -  ences and desires are explained in terms of commitments to cer -  tain patterns of practical inference, that is, in terms of what is a reason for what, instead of the other way around. Different sorts of normative vocabulary are presented as making it possible to codify, in the explicit form of claims (claimables), commitment to the propriety of different patterns of practical reasoning. Against this background, preferences and desires take their place as one sort of commitment among others, distinguished by its structure rather than by any privilege with respect either to reasons or to motivations for action.  Chapter   3 , “Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism,” follows out the application of inferentialist semantic ideas to observation, that is, to perceptual noninferential discursive entrance transitions. The topic is the taking up into the conceptual order of the reliable differential responsive dispositions—for instance, to respond to red things by applying the concept   red —that are essential to the contents of empirical concepts corresponding to observable states  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   3 9  of affairs. The issue is approached through a discussion of contem -  porary epistemological reliabilism, which seeks to put appeals to reliable processes in place of more traditional appeals to inferential justifications—at least in epistemology, and perhaps also in under -  standing the contents of knowledge claims. Three insights and two blindspots of reliabilism are identified. What I call the   Found -  ing Insight   points out that reliably formed true beliefs can qualify as knowledge even where the candidate knower cannot justify them.   Goldman’s Insight   is that attributions of reliability must be relativized to reference classes. The   Implicit Insight   I discern in the examples used to motivate the first two claims is that attribu -  tions of reliability should be understood in terms of endorsements of a distinctive kind of   inference.   The   Conceptual Blindspot   results from overgeneralizing the founding insight from epistemology to semantics, taking it that because there can be knowledge even in cases where the knower cannot offer an inferential justification, it is therefore possible to understand the content of (knowledge) claims without appeal to inference at all. The   Naturalistic Blind -  spot   seeks in reliabilism the basis of a fully naturalized epistemol -  ogy, one that need not appeal to norms or reasons at all. To avoid the Conceptual Blindspot, one must appreciate the significance of specifically inferential articulation in distinguishing representa -  tions that qualify as beliefs, and hence as candidates for knowl -  edge. To avoid the Naturalistic Blindspot, one must appreciate that concern with reliability is concern with a distinctive kind of interpersonal inference. Appreciating the role of inference in these explanatory contexts is grasping the implicit insight of reliabilism. It is what is required to conserve and extend both the Founding Insight and Goldman’s Insight. Thus, reliability should be under -  stood in terms of the goodness of inference rather than the other way around.  The last three chapters take up the challenge of explaining the  referential   or   representational   dimension of concept use and con -  ceptual content in terms of the   inferential   articulation that is here  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n4 0   ◆   Introduction  treated as primary in the order of explanation. To make a claim is to purport to state a fact. Chapter   4   offers an inferentialist account of what it is for the facts stated by true claimings to be about  objects,   and an inferentialist argument to the conclusion that facts  must   be about objects. An inferentialist pragmatism is committed to a top-down order of semantic explanation. It must give pride of place to   propositional   contents, for it is expressions with that sort of content that can play the basic inferential roles of premise and conclusion. The utterance of expressions that are suitable to appear in both these kinds of roles can have the pragmatic force or significance of   assertions,   and so the expressions in question can be identified as declarative   sentences.   Some further work is needed to distinguish   and   attribute   conceptual   content   to   sub sentential expressions such as singular terms and predicates, since they can -  not serve as premises or conclusions in inferences. Frege’s notion of   substitution   provides a way to extend the inferentialist account of the conceptual content of sentences to these sorts of subsenten -  tial expressions. It gives us a way of making sense of the notion of the contribution the occurrence of a subsentential expression makes to the correctness of inferences it appears in (as an element of a premise or conclusion). For we can notice which substitutions of subsentential expressions do, and which do not, preserve the correctness of inferences in which the sentences they occur in play the role of premise or conclusion. In that way, subsentential expressions can be accorded a substitutionally   indirect   inferential role.  Chapter   4 , “What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?” falls into two parts, corresponding to the two parts of its title. The first argues that singular terms and predicates can be dis -  tinguished by the   structure   of the contributions they make to the correctness   of   substitution   inferences   involving   sentences   in which they occur. The second part argues that this is not a contin -  gent or accidental structure. Very general conditions on inferen -  tial practice mandate that   if   inferentially significant subsentential  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   4 1  structure is to be discerned in sentences at all, it   must   take the form of singular terms and predicates—that is, that if we are in the fact-stating line of work at all, the facts we state must be facts about objects and their properties and relations. Although in prin -  ciple it is coherent to conceive of discursive practices that involve only   sentential   expressions   devoid   of   internal   structure,   the expressive power of such languages is severely limited. For the productivity and creativity of language depend on the fact that an indefinite number of novel sentences can be produced and under -  stood because they are constructed out of familiar subsentential elements. The central argument of the chapter is a derivation of the necessity of a singular term and predicate structure (in the pre -  cise substitution inferential sense specified in the first part of the chapter) from just two conditions: that there not be arbitrary restrictions on the carving up of sentences with a substitutional scalpel, and that the language contain the minimal expressive resources of   sentential   logic, namely, conditionals (or negation). Since, according to the inferentialist expressive view of logic, these are the locutions needed to make explicit within the language the material inferential relations in virtue of which ordinary nonlogi -  cal sentences have the conceptual contents they do, this means that singular terms and predicates will be substitutionally dis -  cernible within the basic sentences of any productive, projectible language capable of the minimal semantic self-consciousness made possible by the use of conditionals. The conclusion is that any language with sufficient expressive power concerning its own conceptual contents—never mind the character of the world it is being used to talk about—must take the form of sentences con -  taining singular terms and predicates. That is, it must at least pur -  port to state facts about objects and their properties and relations. I call this, rather grandly,   an expressive transcendental deduction of the necessity of objects.   It is certainly the most difficult part of the book, but the argument, though technical, requires no compe -  tence beyond familiarity with first-order logic.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n4 2   ◆   Introduction  At this point, then, we have seen in some sense what it is for our talk to be about   objects.   Chapter   5 , “A Social Route from Reason -  ing to Representing,” complements this discussion by offering a general account of   aboutness.   It pursues a double-barreled expres -  sivist and pragmatist strategy. On the expressivist side, it aims to understand what is   implicit   in what one is   doing   in terms of the kind of   saying   that makes it   explicit.   Here the aim is to understand the activity of   representing   things as being thus-and-so in terms of the use of the explicitly representational locutions we use to express the representational dimension of concept use. If we put to one side technical, inevitably theory-laden philosophical terms such as ‘denotes’ and some uses of ‘refers’ and ‘represents’, 18   the claim is that the ordinary distinction between what we say or think and what we are talking of thinking   about   is expressed by using terms like ‘of ’ and ‘about’—not in phrases such as “the pen of my aunt” and “weighing about five pounds,” but when used to express intentional directedness, as in “thinking of Benjamin Franklin” and “talking about wolves.” These uses are in turn dis -  tinguished as those used to express   de re   attributions of proposi -  tional attitudes in the explicit, claimable form of ascriptions, such as “Adams claimed   of   Benjamin Franklin that he did not invent the lightning rod” (which might be paraphrased as “Adams repre -  sented Benjamin Franklin as not inventing the lightning rod”). In the pragmatist phase of the argument, then, we ask how one must  use   expressions in order for them to play the expressive role of explicit   de re   ascriptions of propositional attitude. The argument is completed by answering this question by an account of the   infer -  ential   role distinctive of such ascriptions. The claim is that they codify certain   interpersonal   inferential commitments. The result is an account of the role of the explicitly representational vocabulary we use to express intentional directedness as codifying inferential commitments—that is, according to the expressive approach to logic, an account of its specifically   logical   expressive role.  Chapter   6 , “Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Introduction   4 3  Rationality,” offers an argument in two parts, again correspond -  ing to the two parts of the title. First is an argument for a thesis about the norms governing any practices recognizable as includ -  ing the giving of and asking for reasons—any practice in which some performances have the implicit force or significance of asserting and inferring—that is, according to the rationalist lin -  guistic pragmatist line of thought pursued here, any genuinely   dis -  cursive   or concept-using practices. The claim is that those implicit practical norms must, in order to count as discursive, come in at least two flavors. It must be possible for some performances to have the practical significance of undertaking   commitments.   For asserting something is committing oneself to it, and the beliefs those assertions express involve a kind of commitment. It is such commitments that, in the first instance, stand in practical inferen -  tial relations—such as that   by   committing oneself overtly (asser -  tionally) to Leo’s being a lion, one thereby implicitly commits oneself (whether one realizes it or not) to Leo’s being a mammal. And it is the contents of those commitments that stand in the semantic inferential relations that can be made explicit by the use of conditionals. But for such a structure of consequential commit -  ment to count as involving assessments of   reasons,   there must be in play also a notion of   entitlement   to one’s commitments: the sort of entitlement that is in question when we ask whether someone has good   reasons   for her commitments. The question whether or not one is committed to a certain claim(able) must be distinct from the question whether or not one is entitled (by reasons) to that commitment.  What I call here the ‘normative fine structure of rationality’ is the constellation of kinds of broadly inferential relations that is generated once we recognize these two sorts of normative status. For now we can discern and distinguish at least three fundamental ones: commitment-preserving inferences, entitlement-preserving inferences, and incompatibilities. The first is a class of materially good inferences (that is, ones whose correctness or incorrectness  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n4 4   ◆   Introduction  essentially depends on or articulates the content of the nonlogical concepts that occur in their premises or conclusions) that general -  izes what appears in the formalist tradition of logic as   deductive  inferences. The second is a class of materially good inferences that generalizes what appears in the formalist tradition as   inductive  inferences. The third has no classical analog. We can say that two claims are materially incompatible in case commitment to one precludes entitlement to the other. (This is a   normative   relation. One can undertake incompatible assertible commitments as easily and intelligibly as one can undertake incompatible practical ones, for instance, by making two promises both of which cannot be kept. What one cannot do is be   entitled   to both—indeed, in stan -  dard cases, to either—of the incompatible commitments.) This richer   practical   inferential   structure   provides   important   new resources for   logic.   For instance, one can define the   negation   of   p  as its minimum incompatible: it is the claim that is commitment entailed by every claim materially incompatible with   p.   It also pro -  vides important new resources for   semantics.   The final portion of the chapter shows how this structure of reasoning makes it pos -  sible to understand subjecting our claims to assessments accord -  ing to a kind of correctness in which authority is invested in the  things   we are (in that central normative sense) talking   about   rather than in our   attitudes   toward them. Thus, by the end of the discus -  sion we see how inferentially articulated conceptual norms can underwrite assessments of   objective   correctness of representation.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆   ◆   ◆  ON E  Semantic Inferentialis m  and Logical Expressivis m  I.   Introduction  I want to introduce here a way of thinking about semantics that is different from more familiar ones, and on that basis also a new way of thinking about logic. In case that seems insufficiently ambitious, I will introduce these ideas by sketching a different way of thinking about some important episodes in the history of phi -  losophy in the era that stretches from Descartes to Kant. I then explain and motivate the two ideas indicated in the title by putting together   considerations   drawn   from   three   different   thinkers, Frege, Dummett, and Sellars, or, as I think of them, the sage of Jena, the sage of Oxford, and the sage of Pittsburgh. In each case I pick up strands other than those usually emphasized when we read these figures.  II.   Representationalism and Inferentialism  Pre-Kantian empiricists and rationalists alike were notoriously disposed to run together causal and conceptual issues, largely through insufficient appreciation of the normative character of the “order and connection of ideas” (Spinoza) that matters for concepts. But there is another, perhaps less appreciated, contrast  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n4 6   ◆   Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism  in play during this period, besides that of the causal and the con -  ceptual, the origin and the justification of our ideas. Enlighten -  ment epistemology was always the home for two somewhat uneasily coexisting conceptions of the conceptual. The funda -  mental concept of the dominant and characteristic understanding of cognitive contentfulness in the period initiated by Descartes is of course   representation.   There is, however, a minority semantic tradition that takes   inference   rather than representation as its mas -  ter concept.  Rationalists such as Spinoza and Leibniz accepted the central role of the concept of representation in explaining human cogni -  tive activity. But they were not prepared to accept Descartes’s strategy of treating the possession of representational content as an unexplained explainer—just dividing the world into what is by nature a representing and what by nature can only be represented. Each of them developed instead an account of what it is for one thing to represent another, in terms of the inferential significance of the representing. They were explicitly concerned, as Descartes was not, to be able to explain what it is for something to be under -  stood, taken, treated, or employed   as   a representing   by   the sub -  ject: what it is for it to be a representing   to   or   for   that subject (to be “tanquam rem,” as if of things, as Descartes puts it). Their idea was that the way in which representings point beyond themselves to something represented is to be understood in terms of   inferen -  tial   relations among representings. States and acts acquire content by being caught up in inferences, as premises and conclusions.  Thus a big divide within Enlightenment epistemology concerns the relative explanatory priority accorded to the concepts of repre -  sentation and inference. The British empiricists were more puz -  zled than Descartes about representational purport: the property of so much as seeming to be   about   something. But they were clear in seeking to derive inferential relations from the contents of rep -  resentings rather than the other way around. In this regard they belong to the still dominant tradition that reads inferential cor-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism   4 7  rectnesses   off   from   representational   correctnesses,   which   are assumed to be antecedently intelligible. That is why Hume could take for granted the contents of his individual representings but worry about how they could possibly underwrite the correctness of inductive inferences. The post-Cartesian rationalists, the claim goes, give rise to a tradition based on a complementary semanti -  cally reductive order of explanation. (So Kant, picking up the thread from this tradition, will come to see their involvement in counterfactually robust inferences as essential to empirical repre -  sentations having the contents that they do.) These   inferentialists  seek to define representational properties in terms of inferential ones, which must accordingly be capable of being understood antecedently. They start with a notion of content as determining what is a   reason   for what, and understand truth and representation as features of ideas that are not only manifested in but actually  consist   in their role in reasoning. I actually think that the division of pre-Kantian philosophers into representationalists and inferen -  tialists cuts according to deeper principles of their thought than does the nearly coextensional division of them into empiricists and rationalists, though it goes far beyond my brief to argue for that thesis here.  III.   Inferentialism and Noninferential Reports  The concepts for which inferential notions of content are least obviously appropriate are those associated with observable prop -  erties, such as colors. For the characteristic use of such concepts is precisely in making   non inferential reports, such as “This ball is red.” One of the most important lessons we can learn from Sell -  ars’s masterwork, “Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind” (as from the “Sense Certainty” section of Hegel’s   Phenomenology ), is the inferentialist one that even such noninferential reports must be inferentially articulated. Without that requirement, we cannot tell the difference between noninferential reporters and automatic  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n4 8   ◆   Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism  machinery such as thermostats and photocells, which also have reliable dispositions to respond differentially to stimuli. What is the important difference between a thermostat that turns the fur -  nace on when the temperature drops to sixty degrees, or a parrot trained to say “That’s red” in the presence of red things, on the one hand, and a genuine noninferential reporter of those circum -  stances, on the other? Each classifies particular stimuli as being of a general kind, the kind, namely, that elicits a repeatable response of a certain sort. In the same sense, of course, a chunk of iron clas -  sifies its environment as being of one of two kinds, depending on whether it responds by rusting or not. It is easy, but uninforma -  tive, to say that what distinguishes reporters from reliable respon -  ders is awareness. In this use the term is tied to the notion of understanding: the thermostat and the parrot do not understand their responses, those responses mean nothing to them, though they can mean something to us. We can add that the distinction wanted is that between merely responsive classification and specif -  ically   conceptual   classification. The reporter must, as the parrot and thermostat do not, have the   concept   of temperature or cold. It is classifying under such a concept, something the reporter under -  stands or grasps the meaning of, that makes the relevant difference.  It is at this point that Sellars introduces his central thought: that for a response to have   conceptual   content is just for it to play a role in the   inferential   game of making claims and giving and asking for reasons. To grasp or understand such a concept is to have practical mastery over the inferences it is involved in—to know, in the prac -  tical sense of being able to distinguish (a kind of know- how ), what follows from the applicability of a concept, and what it follows from. The parrot does not treat “That’s red” as incompatible with “That’s green,” nor as following from “That’s scarlet” and entail -  ing “That’s colored.” Insofar as the repeatable response is not, for the parrot, caught up in practical proprieties of inference and jus -  tification, and so of the making of further judgments, it is not a  conceptual   or a   cognitive   matter at all.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism   4 9  It follows immediately from such an inferential demarcation of the conceptual that in order to master   any   concepts, one must master   many   concepts. For grasp of one concept consists in mas -  tery of at least some of its inferential relations to other concepts. Cognitively, grasp of just one concept is the sound of one hand clapping. Another consequence is that to be able to apply one concept   non inferentially, one must be able to use others   inferen -  tially.   For unless applying it can serve at least as a premise from which to draw inferential consequences, it is not functioning as a concept at all. So the idea that there could be an autonomous lan -  guage game, one that could be played though one played no other, consisting entirely of noninferential reports (in the case Sel -  lars is most concerned with in “Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind,” even of the current contents of one’s own mind) is a radi -  cal mistake. (Of course this is compatible with there being lan -  guages without theoretical concepts, that is, concepts whose   only  use is inferential. The requirement is that for   any   concepts to have reporting uses, some concepts must have   non reporting uses.)  IV.   Frege on   Begriffliche Inhalt  My purpose at the moment, however, is to pursue not the   conse -  quences   of the inferential understanding of conceptual contents that Sellars recommends, but its   antecedents.   The predecessor it is most interesting to consider is the young Frege. Frege may seem an unlikely heir to this inferentialist tradition. After all, he is usu -  ally thought of as the father of the contemporary way of working out the   representationalist   order of explanation, which starts with an independent notion of relations of reference or denotation obtaining between mental or linguistic items and objects and sets of objects in the largely nonmental, nonlinguistic environment, and determines from these, in the familiar fashion, first truth con -  ditions for the sentential representings built out of the subsenten -  tial ones, and then, from these, a notion of goodness of inference  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n5 0   ◆   Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism  understood in terms of set-theoretic inclusions among the associ -  ated sets of truth conditions. But insofar as it is appropriate to read this twentieth-century story back into Frege at all, and I am not sure that it is, it would be possible only beginning with the Frege of the   1890 s. He starts his semantic investigations not with the idea of reference but with that of inference. His seminal first work, the   Begriffsschrift   of   1879 , takes as its aim the explication of “conceptual   content”   (begriffliche   Inhalt).   The   qualification “conceptual” is explicitly construed in inferential terms:  There are two ways in which the content of two judgments may differ; it may, or it may not, be the case that all inferences that can be drawn from the first judgment when combined with cer -  tain other ones can always also be drawn from the second when combined with the same other judgments. The two propositions ‘the Greeks defeated the Persians at Plataea’ and ‘the Persians were defeated by the Greeks at Plataea’ differ in the former way; even if a slight difference of sense is discernible, the agreement in sense is preponderant. Now I call that part of the content that is the same in both the conceptual content. Only this has signifi -  cance for our symbolic language [ Begriffsschrift ] . . . In my for -  malized language [ BGS ] . . . only that part of judgments which affects the possible inferences is taken into consideration. What -  ever is needed for a correct [ richtig,   usually misleadingly trans -  lated as “valid”] inference is fully expressed; what is not needed is . . . not. 1  Two claims have the same conceptual content if and only if they have the same inferential role: a good inference is never turned into a bad one by substituting one for the other. This way of specifying the explanatory target to which semantic theories, including referential ones, are directed is picked up by Frege’s student Carnap, who in   The Logical Syntax of Language   defines the content of a sentence as the class of nonvalid sentences which are its consequences (that is, can be inferred from it). Sellars in  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism   5 1  turn picks up the idea from him, as his references to this definition  indicate. By contrast, the tradition Frege initiated in the   1890 s makes  truth, rather than inference, primary in the order of explanation.  Dummett says of this shift:  In this respect (and [Dummett implausibly but endearingly has -  tens to add] in this respect alone) Frege’s new approach to logic was retrograde. He characterized logic by saying that, while all sciences have truth as their goal, in logic truth is not merely the goal, but the object of study. The traditional answer to the ques -  tion what is the subject-matter of logic is, however, that it is, not truth, but inference, or, more properly, the relation of logical consequence. This was the received opinion all through the dol -  drums of logic, until the subject was revitalized by Frege; and it is, surely, the correct view. 2  And again:  It remains that the representation of logic as concerned with a characteristic of sentences, truth, rather than of transitions from sentences to sentences, had highly deleterious effects both in logic and in philosophy. In philosophy it led to a concen -  tration on logical truth and its generalization, analytic truth, as the problematic notions, rather than on the notion of a state -  ment’s being a deductive consequence of other statements, and hence to solutions involving a distinction between two suppos -  edly utterly different kinds of truth, analytic truth and contin -  gent   truth,   which   would   have   appeared   preposterous   and irrelevant if the central problem had from the start been taken to be that of the character of the relation of deductive con -  sequence. 3  The important thing to realize is that the young Frege has not  yet made this false step. Two further points to keep in mind re -  garding this passage are, first, shifting from concern with inference  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n5 2   ◆   Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism  to concern with truth is one move, understanding truth in terms of prior primitive reference relations is another. Since the ma -  ture Frege treats truth as indefinable and primitive, the extrac -  tion of a representationalist commitment even from the texts of the   1890 s requires further showing (compare Davidson’s truth -  without-reference view in our own day). Second, understanding the topic of logic in terms of inference is not the same as seeing it in terms of logical inference, or of “deductive consequence,” as Dummett puts it (I talk about this below under the heading of “formalism” about inference). The view propounded and attrib -  uted to Frege below is different from, and from the contemporary vantage point more surprising than, the one Dummett endorses here.  V.   Material Inference  The kind of inference whose correctnesses determine the con -  ceptual contents of its premises and conclusions may be called, following Sellars,   material   inferences. As examples, consider the inference   from   “Pittsburgh   is   to   the   west   of   Princeton”   to “Princeton is to the east of Pittsburgh,” and that from “Lightning is seen now” to “Thunder will be heard soon.” It is the contents of the concepts   west   and   east   that make the first a good inference, and the contents of the concepts   lightning   and   thunder,   as well as the temporal concepts, that make the second appropriate. Endors -  ing these inferences is part of grasping or mastering those con -  cepts, quite apart from any specifically   logical   competence.  Often, however,   inferential   articulation is identified with   logi -  cal   articulation. Material inferences are accordingly treated as a derivative category. The idea is that being rational—being subject to the normative force of the better reason, which so puzzled and fascinated the Greeks—can be understood as a purely logical capacity. In part this tendency was encouraged by merely verbally sloppy formulations of the crucial difference between the inferen-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism   5 3  tial force of reasons and the physically efficacious force of causes, which render it as the difference between ‘logical’ and ‘natural’ compulsion. Mistakes ensue, however, if the concept   logical   is employed with these circumstances of application conjoined with consequences of application that restrict the notion of logical force of reasons to formally valid inferences. The substantial com -  mitment that is fundamental to this sort of approach is what Sell -  ars calls “the received dogma . . . that the inference which finds its expression in ‘It is raining, therefore the streets will be wet’ is an enthymeme.” 4  According to this line of thought, wherever an inference is en -  dorsed, it is because of belief in a conditional. Thus the instanced inference is understood as implicitly involving the conditional “If it is raining, then the streets will be wet.” With that “suppressed” premise supplied, the inference is an instance of the formally valid scheme of conditional detachment. The “dogma” expresses a commitment to an order of explanation that treats all inferences as good or bad solely in virtue of their form, with the contents of the claims they involve mattering only for the truth of the (implicit) premises. According to this way of setting things out, there is no such thing as material inference. This view, which understands “good inference” to mean “formally valid inference,” postulating implicit premises as needed, might be called a formalist approach to inference. It trades primitive goodnesses of inference for the truth of conditionals. Doing so is taking the retrograde step that Dummett complains about. (It is also what introduces the prob -  lem Lewis Carroll exposes in “Achilles and the Tortoise.”) The grasp of logic that is attributed must be an implicit grasp, since it need be manifested only in distinguishing material inferences as good and bad, not in any further capacity to manipulate logical vocabulary or endorse tautologies involving them. But what then is the explanatory payoff from attributing such an implicit logical ability rather than just the capacity to assess proprieties of material inference?  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n5 4   ◆   Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism  The approach Sellars endorses is best understood by reference to the full list of alternatives he considers:  We have been led to distinguish the following six conceptions of  the status of material rules of inference:  ( 1 )   Material rules are as essential to meaning (and hence to lan -  guage and thought) as formal rules, contributing to the architectural detail of its structure within the flying but -  tresses of logical form.  ( 2 )   While not essential to meaning, material rules of inference have an original authority not derived from formal rules, and play an indispensable role in our thinking on matters of fact.  ( 3 )   Same as ( 2 ) save that the acknowledgment of material rules of inference is held to be a dispensable feature of thought, at best a matter of convenience.  ( 4 )   Material rules of inference have a purely derivative authority, though they are genuinely rules of inference.  ( 5 )   The sentences which raise these puzzles about material rules of inference are merely abridged formulations of logically valid inferences. (Clearly the distinction between an infer -  ence and the formulation of an inference would have to be explored.)  ( 6 )   Trains of thought which are said to be governed by “ma -  terial rules of inference” are actually not inferences at all, but rather activated associations which mimic inference, concealing   their   intellectual   nudity   with   stolen   “there -  fores.” 5  His own position is that an expression has conceptual content conferred on it by being caught up in, playing a certain role in, material inferences: “It is the first (or ‘rationalistic’) alternative to which we are committed. According to it, material transformation rules determine the descriptive meaning of the expressions of a  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism   5 5  language within the framework provided by its logical transforma -  tion rules . . . In traditional language, the ‘content’ of concepts as well as their logical ‘form’ is determined by the rules of the Understanding.” 6  Should inferentialist explanations begin with inferences per -  taining to propositional   form   or those pertaining to propositional  content?   One important consideration is that the notion of for -  mally valid inferences is definable in a natural way from that of materially correct ones, while there is no converse route. For given a subset of vocabulary that is privileged or distinguished somehow, an inference can be treated as good in virtue of its form, with respect to that vocabulary, just in case  It is a materially good inference, and  It cannot be turned into a materially bad one by substituting  nonprivileged for nonprivileged vocabulary in its premises  and conclusions.  Notice that this substitutional notion of formally good inferences need have nothing special to do with   logic.   If it is   logical   form that is of interest, then one must antecedently be able to distinguish some vocabulary as peculiarly logical. That done, the Fregean semantic strategy of looking for inferential features that are invari -  ant under substitution yields a notion of   logically   valid inferences. But if one picks out   theo logical (or aesthetic) vocabulary as privi -  leged, then looking at which substitutions of nontheological (or nonaesthetic) vocabulary for nontheological (nonaesthetic) vocabulary preserve material goodness of inference will pick out inferences good in virtue of their   theo logical (or aesthetic) form. According to this way of thinking, the   formal   goodness of in -  ferences derives from and is explained in terms of the   material  goodness of inferences, and so ought not to be appealed to in explaining it. Frege’s inferentialist way of specifying the character -  istic linguistic role in virtue of which vocabulary qualifies as logical is discussed below.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n5 6   ◆   Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism  VI.   Elucidative Rationality  So far I have indicated briefly two related claims: that conceptual contents are inferential roles, and that the inferences that matter for such contents in general must be conceived to include those that are in some sense   materially correct,   not just those that are  formally valid.   I will argue in a moment that a commitment to the second of these, no less than the first, is to be found already in Frege’s early writings, though not in the developed form to which Sellars brings it. But in both thinkers these ideas are combined with a third, which I believe makes this line of thought especially attractive. In one of his early papers, Sellars introduces the idea this way: “Socratic method serves the purpose of making explicit the rules we have adopted for thought and action, and I shall be interpreting our judgments to the effect that A causally necessi -  tates B as the expression of a rule governing our use of the terms ‘A’ and ‘B’.” 7   Sellars understands such modal statements as in -  ference licenses, which formulate as the content of a claim the appropriateness of inferential transitions. More than this, he un -  derstands the function of such statements to be making explicit, in the form of assertible rules, commitments that had hitherto remained implicit in inferential practices. Socratic method is a way of bringing our practices under rational control by expressing them explicitly in a form in which they can be confronted with objections and alternatives, a form in which they can be exhibited as the conclusions of inferences seeking to justify them on the basis of premises advanced as reasons, and as premises in further inferences exploring the consequences of accepting them.  In the passage just quoted, Sellars tells us that the enterprise within which we ought to understand the characteristic function of inference licenses is a form of rationality that centers on the notion of   expression:   making   explicit   in a form that can be thought or said what is   implicit   in what is done. This is a dark and pregnant claim, but I believe it epitomizes a radical and distinctive insight.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism   5 7  In what follows I hope to shed some light on it and its role in an inferentialist vision of things. The general idea is that the paradig -  matically rational process that Sellars invokes under the heading of “Socratic method” depends on the possibility of making implicit commitments explicit in the form of claims.   Expressing   them in this sense is bringing them into the game of giving and asking for reasons as playing the special sort of role in virtue of which some -  thing has a conceptual content at all, namely, an inferential role, as premise and conclusion of inferences. This sort of rationality is distinct from, but obviously related to, the sort of rationality that then consists in making the appropriate inferential moves. Even totalitarian versions of the latter—for instance, those that would assimilate all goodness of inference to logical validity, or to instru -  mental prudence (that is, efficiency at getting what one wants)— depend on the possibility of expressing considerations in a form in which they can be given as reasons, and reasons demanded for them. All the more does Socratic reflection on our practices—par -  ticularly on those material-inferential practices that determine the conceptual contents of thoughts and beliefs—depend on the pos -  sibility of their explicit expression.  VII.   Frege on the Expressive Role of Logic  To begin to explicate this notion of explication, it is helpful to return to the consideration of the young Frege’s inferentialist pro -  gram. Frege’s   Begriffsschrift   is remarkable not only for the infer -  ential idiom in which it specifies its topic, but equally for how it conceives its relation to that topic. The task of the work is officially an expressive one: not to prove something but to say something. Frege’s logical notation is designed for expressing conceptual contents, making explicit the inferential involvements that are implicit in anything that possesses such content. As the passage quoted earlier puts it, “Whatever is needed for a correct inference is fully expressed.” Talking about this project, Frege says: “Right  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n5 8   ◆   Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism  from the start I had in mind the expression of a content. . . But the content is to be rendered more exactly than is done by verbal lan -  guage. . . Speech often only indicates by inessential marks or by imagery what a concept-script should spell out in full.” 8   The concept-script is a formal language for the explicit codification of conceptual   contents.   In   the   Preface   to   Begriffsschrift,   Frege laments that even in science concepts are formed haphazardly, so that the ones employing them are scarcely aware of what they mean, of what their content really is. When the correctness of par -  ticular inferences is at issue, this sort of unclarity may preclude rational settlement of the issue. What is needed is a notation within which the rough-and-ready conceptual contents of the sci -  ences, beginning with mathematics, can be reformulated so as to wear their contents on their sleeves. The explanatory target here avowedly concerns a sort of inference, not a sort of truth, and the sort of inference involved is content-conferring material infer -  ences, not the derivative formal ones.  Frege explicitly contrasts his approach with that of those, such as Boole, who conceive their formal language only in terms of for -  mal inference, and so express no material contents:  The reason for this inability to form concepts in a scientific man -  ner lies in the lack of one of the two components of which every highly developed language must consist. That is, we may distin -  guish the formal part . . . from the material part proper. The signs of arithmetic correspond to the latter. What we still lack is the logical cement that will bind these building stones firmly together. . . In contrast, Boole’s symbolic logic only represents the formal part of the language. 9  By contrast, Frege continues:  1 .   My concept-script has a more far-reaching aim than Boolean logic, in that it strives to make it possible to present a content when combined with arithmetical and geometrical signs . . .  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism   5 9  2 .   Disregarding content, within the domain of pure logic it also, thanks to the notation for generality, commands a somewhat wider domain . . .  4 .   It is in a position to represent the formation of the concepts actually needed in science . . . 10  It is the wider domain to which his expressive ambition extends that Frege sees as characteristic of his approach. Since contents are determined by inferences, expressing inferences explicitly will per -  mit the expression of any sort of content at all: “It seems to me to be easier still to extend the domain of this formula language to include geometry. We would only have to add a few signs for the intuitive relations that occur there. . . The transition to the pure theory of motion and then to mechanics and physics could follow at this point.” 11  Frege’s early understanding of logic offers some specific con -  tent to the notion of explicitly expressing what is implicit in a con -  ceptual content, which is what is required to fill in a notion of expressive or elucidating rationality that might be laid alongside (and perhaps even be discovered to be presupposed by) notions of rationality as accurate representation, as logically valid inference, and as instrumental practical reasoning. Before one takes the fate -  ful step from seeing logic as an attempt to codify inferences to see -  ing it as the search for a special kind of truth, which Dummett bemoans, Frege’s aim is to introduce vocabulary that will let one  say   (explicitly) what otherwise one can only   do   (implicitly). Con -  sider the conditional, with which the   Begriffsschrift   begins. Frege says of it: “The precisely defined hypothetical relation between contents of possible judgments [Frege’s conditional] has a similar significance for the foundation of my concept-script to that which identity of extensions has for Boolean logic.” 12   I think it is hard to overestimate the importance of this passage in understanding what is distinctive about Frege’s   Begriffsschrift   project. After all, contemporary Tarskian model-theoretic semantics depends  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n6 0   ◆   Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism  precisely on relations among extensions. Frege is saying that his distinctive idea—in what is, after all, the founding document of modern formal logic—is to do things otherwise.  Why the conditional? Prior to the introduction of such a condi -  tional locution, one could   do   something, one could treat a judg -  ment as having a certain content (implicitly attribute that content to it) by endorsing various inferences involving it and rejecting others. After conditional locutions have been introduced, one can  say,   as part of the content of a claim (something that can serve as a premise and conclusion in inference),   that   a certain inference is acceptable. One is able to make explicit material inferential rela -  tions between an antecedent or premise and a consequent or con -  clusion. Since, according to the inferentialist view of conceptual contents, it is these implicitly recognized material inferential rela -  tions that conceptual contents consist in, the conditional permits such contents to be explicitly expressed. If there is a disagreement about the goodness of an inference, it is possible to say what the dispute is about and offer reasons one way or the other. The con -  ditional is the paradigm of a locution that permits one to make inferential commitments explicit as the contents of judgments. In a   similar   fashion,   introducing   negation   makes   it   possible   to express explicitly material incompatibilities of sentences, which also contribute to their content. The picture is accordingly one whereby, first, formal validity of inferences is defined in terms of materially correct inferences and some privileged vocabulary; sec -  ond, that privileged vocabulary is identified as logical vocabulary; and third, what it is for something to be a bit of logical vocabulary is explained in terms of its semantically expressive role.  Frege is not as explicit about the role of materially correct infer -  ences as Sellars is, but his commitment to the notion is clear from the relation between two of the views that have been extracted from the   Begriffsschrift:   expressivism about logic and inferential -  ism about content. Expressivism about logic means that Frege treats logical vocabulary as having a distinctive expressive role:  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism   6 1  making explicit the inferences that are implicit in the conceptual contents of nonlogical concepts. Inferentialism about those con -  ceptual contents means taking them to be identified and individu -  ated by their inferential roles. Together these views require that it be coherent to talk about inference prior to the introduction of specifically logical vocabulary, and so prior to the identification of any inferences as good in virtue of their form. In the context of an inferential understanding of conceptual contents, an expressivist approach presupposes a notion of nonlogical inference, the infer -  ences in virtue of which concepts have nonlogical content. Thus the young Frege envisages a field of material inferences that confer conceptual content on sentences caught up in them. So although Frege does not offer an explanation of the concept, in the   Be -  griffsschrift   his expressive, explicitating project commits him to something playing the role Sellars later picks out by the phrase “material inference.”  VIII.   Dummett’s Model and Gentzen  So far three themes have been introduced:  That conceptual content is to be understood in terms of role in reasoning rather than exclusively in terms of representation; That the capacity for such reasoning is not to be identified exclu -  sively with mastery of a logical calculus; and  That besides theoretical and practical reasoning using contents constituted by their role in material inferences, there is a kind of   expressive   rationality   that   consists   in   making   implicit content-conferring inferential commitments explicit as the contents of assertible commitments. In this way, the material inferential practices, which govern and make possible the game of giving and asking for reasons, are brought into that game, and so into consciousness, as explicit topics of discus -  sion and justification.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n6 2   ◆   Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism  These three themes, to be found in the early works of both Frege and Sellars, provide the beginnings of the structure within which modern inferentialism develops. These ideas can be made more definite by considering a general model of conceptual contents as inferential   roles   that   has   been   recommended   by   Dummett. According to that model, the use of any linguistic expression or concept has two aspects: the   circumstances   under which it is cor -  rectly applied, uttered, or used, and the appropriate   consequences  of its application, utterance, or use. Though Dummett does not make this point, this model can be connected to inferentialism via the principle that the content to which one is committed by using the concept or expression may be represented by the inference one implicitly endorses by such use, the inference, namely, from the circumstances of appropriate employment to the appropriate consequences of such employment.  The original source for the model lies in a treatment of the grammatical category of sentential connectives. Dummett’s two -  aspect model is a generalization of a standard way of specifying the inferential roles of logical connectives, owing ultimately to Gentzen. Gentzen famously defined connectives by specifying introduction rules, or inferentially sufficient conditions for the employment of the connective, and elimination rules, or inferen -  tially necessary consequences of the employment of the connec -  tive. So, to define the inferential role of an expression ‘&’ of Boolean conjunction, one specifies that anyone who is committed to   p,   and committed to   q,   is thereby to count also as committed to  p & q,   and that anyone who is committed to   p & q   is thereby com -  mitted both to   p   and to   q.   The first schema specifies, by means of expressions that do not contain the connective, the circumstances under which one is committed to claims expressed by sentences that do contain (as principal connective) the connective whose inferential role is being defined, that is, the sets of premises that entail them. The second schema specifies, by means of expressions that do not contain the connective, the consequences of being  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism   6 3  committed to claims expressed by sentences that do contain (as principal connective) the connective whose inferential role is being defined, that is, the sets of consequences that they entail.  IX.   Circumstances and Consequences for Sentences  Dummett makes a remarkable contribution to inferentialist ap -  proaches to conceptual content by showing how this model can be generalized from logical connectives to provide a uniform treatment of the meanings of expressions of other grammatical categories, in particular sentences, predicates and common nouns, and singular terms. The application to the propositional contents expressed by whole sentences is straightforward. What corresponds to an   introduction   rule for a propositional content is the set of   suf -  ficient   conditions for asserting it, and what corresponds to an  elimination   rule is the set of   necessary   consequences of asserting it, that is, what follows from doing so. Dummett says: “Learning to use a statement of a given form involves, then, learning two things: the conditions under which one is justified in making the statement; and what constitutes acceptance of it, i.e., the conse -  quences of accepting it.” 13   Dummett presents his model as speci -  fying two fundamental features of the   use   of linguistic expressions, an idea I will return to below. In what follows here, though, I apply it in the context of the previous ideas to bring into relief the implicit material inferential   content   a concept or expression acquires in virtue of being used in the ways specified by these two ‘aspects’. The link between pragmatic significance and inferential content is supplied by the fact that asserting a sentence is implicitly under -  taking a commitment to the correctness of the material inference from its circumstances to its consequences of application.  Understanding or grasping a propositional content is here pre -  sented not as the turning on of a Cartesian light, but as practical mastery   of   a   certain   kind   of   inferentially   articulated   doing: responding differentially according to the circumstances of proper  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n6 4   ◆   Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism  application of a concept, and distinguishing the proper inferential consequences of such application. This is not an all-or-none affair; the metallurgist understands the concept   tellurium   better than I do, for training has made her master of the inferential intricacies of its employment in a way that I can only crudely approximate. Thinking clearly is on this inferentialist rendering a matter of knowing what one is committing oneself to by a certain claim, and what would entitle one to that commitment. Writing clearly is providing enough clues for a reader to infer what one intends to be committed to by each claim, and what one takes it would en -  title one to that commitment. Failure to grasp either of these components is failure to grasp the inferential commitment that use of the concept involves, and so failure to grasp its conceptual content.  Failure to think about both the circumstances and consequences of application leads to semantic theories that are literally one-sided. Verificationists, assertibilists, and reliabilists make the mistake of treating the   first   aspect as exhausting content. Understanding or grasping a content is taken to consist in practically mastering the circumstances under which one becomes entitled or committed to endorse a claim, quite apart from any grasp of what one becomes entitled or committed to by such endorsement. But this cannot be right. For claims can have the same circumstances of application and different consequences of application, as for instance “I fore -  see that I will write a book about Hegel” and “I will write a book about Hegel” do. We can at least regiment a use of ‘foresee’ that makes the former sentence have just the same assertibility condi -  tions as the latter. But substituting the one for the other turns the very safe conditional “If I will write a book about Hegel, then I will write a book about Hegel,” into the risky “If I   foresee   that I will write a book about Hegel, then I will write a book about Hegel.” The possibility that I might be hit by a bus does not affect the assessment of the inference codified by the first conditional, but is quite relevant to the assessment of the second inference.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism   6 5  And the point of the discussion, at the beginning of this chap -  ter, of Sellars’s application of inferentialist ideas to the under -  standing of noninferential reports was that parrots and photocells and so on might reliably discriminate the circumstances in which the concept   red   should be applied, without thereby grasping that concept, precisely in the case where they have no mastery of the consequences of such application—when they cannot tell that it follows from something being red that it is colored, that it is not a prime number, and so on. You do not convey to me the content of the concept   gleeb   by supplying me with an infallible gleebness tester which lights up when and only when exposed to gleeb things. I would in that case know what things were gleeb without knowing what I was saying about them when I called them that, what I had found out about them or committed myself to. Dum -  mett offers two examples of philosophically important concepts where it is useful to be reminded of this point:  An account, however accurate, of the conditions under which some predicate is rightly applied may thus miss important intu -  itive features of its meaning; in particular, it may leave out what we take to be the point of our use of the predicate. A philosoph -  ical account of the notion of truth can thus not necessarily be attained by a definition of the predicate ‘true’, even if one is pos -  sible, since such a definition may be correct only in the sense that it specifies correctly the application of the predicate, while leav -  ing the connections between this predicate and other notions quite obscure. 14  Even more clearly:  A good example would be the word ‘valid’ as applied to various forms of argument. We might reckon the syntactic characteriza -  tion of validity as giving the criterion for applying the predicate ‘valid’ to an argument, and the semantic characterization of validity as giving the consequences of such an application . . . [I]f  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n6 6   ◆   Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism  [one] is taught in a very unimaginative way, [one] may see the classification of arguments into valid and invalid ones as resem -  bling the classification of poems into sonnets and non-sonnets, and so fail to grasp that the fact that an argument is valid pro -  vides any grounds for accepting the conclusion if one accepts the premises. We should naturally say that [one] had missed the point of the distinction. 15  Pragmatists of the classical sort, by contrast, make the converse mistake of identifying propositional contents exclusively with the  consequences   of endorsing a claim, looking downstream to the claim’s role as a premise in practical reasoning and ignoring its proper antecedents upstream. (For present purposes, that the emphasis is on   practical   consequences does not matter.) Yet one can know what follows from the claim that someone is responsible for a particular action, that an action is immoral or sinful, that a remark is true or in bad taste, without for that reason counting as understanding the claims involved, if one has no idea when it is appropriate to make those claims or apply those concepts. Being classified as AWOL does have the consequence that one is liable to be arrested, but the specific circumstances under which one acquires that liability are equally essential to the concept.  X.   ‘Derivation’, Prior, Belnap, and Conservativeness  Of course, such one-sided theories do not simply ignore the aspects of content they do not treat as central. Dummett writes:  Most philosophical observations about meaning embody a claim to perceive . . . a simple pattern: the meaning of a sentence con -  sists in the conditions for its truth and falsity, or in the method of its verification, or in the practical consequences of accepting it. Such dicta cannot be taken to be so naive as to involve overlook -  ing the fact that there are many other features of the use of a sen -  tence than the one singled out as being that in which its meaning  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism   6 7  consists: rather, the hope is that we shall be able to give an account of the connection that exists between the different aspects of meaning. One particular aspect will be taken as cen -  tral, as constitutive of the meaning of any given sentence . . . ; all other features of the use of the sentence will then be explained by a uniform account of their derivation from that feature taken as central. 16  I think this is a very helpful way to think about the structure of theories of meaning in general, but two observations should be made. First, the principle that the task of a theory of meaning is to explain the use of expressions to which meanings are attributed does not mandate identifying meaning with an aspect of use. Per -  haps meanings are to use as theoretical entities are to the observ -  able ones whose antics they are postulated to explain. We need not follow Dummett in his semantic instrumentalism. Second, one might deny that there are meanings in this sense, that is, deny that all the features of the use of an expression can be derived in a uni -  form way from anything we know about it. Dummett suggests that this is the view of the later Wittgenstein. One who takes lan -  guage to be a motley in this sense will deny that there are such things as meanings to be the objects of a theory (without, of course, denying that expressions are meaningful). Keeping these caveats in mind, we will find that pursuing this notion of   deriva -  tion   provides a helpful perspective on the idea of conceptual con -  tents articulated according to material inferences, and on the role of explicit inference licenses such as conditional statements in expressing and elucidating such inferences, and so such contents.  For the special case of defining the inferential roles of logical connectives by pairs of sets of rules for their introduction and for their elimination, which motivates Dummett’s broader model, there is a special condition which it is appropriate to impose on the relation between the two sorts of rules: “In the case of a logi -  cal constant, we may regard the introduction rules governing it as  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n6 8   ◆   Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism  giving conditions for the assertion of a statement of which it is the main operator, and the elimination rules as giving the conse -  quences of such a statement: the demand for harmony between them is then expressible as the requirement that the addition of the constant to a language produces a conservative extension of that language.” 17   Recognition of the appropriateness of such a requirement arises from consideration of connectives with ‘incon -  sistent’ contents. As Prior 18   pointed out, if we define a connective, which after Belnap we may call “tonk,” 19   as having the introduc -  tion rule proper to disjunction and the elimination rule proper to conjunction, then the first rule licenses the transition from   p   to   p  tonk   q,   for arbitrary   q,   and the second licenses the transition from  p   tonk   q   to   q,   and we have what he called a “runabout inference ticket” permitting any arbitrary inference. Prior thought that this possibility shows the bankruptcy of Gentzen-style definitions of inferential roles. Belnap shows rather that when logical vocabulary is being introduced, one must constrain such definitions by the condition that the rule not license any inferences involving only old vocabulary that were not already licensed before the logical vocabulary was introduced, that is, that the new rules provide an inferentially conservative extension of the original field of infer -  ences. Such a constraint is necessary and sufficient to keep from getting   into   trouble   with   Gentzen-style   definitions.   But   the expressive account of what disinguishes logical vocabulary shows us a deep   reason   for this demand; it is needed not only to avoid horrible consequences but also because otherwise logical vocabu -  lary cannot perform its expressive function. Unless the introduc -  tion   and   elimination   rules   are   inferentially   conservative,   the introduction of the new vocabulary licenses new material infer -  ences, and so alters the contents associated with the old vocabu -  lary. So if logical vocabulary is to play its distinctive expressive role of making explicit the original material inferences, and so concep -  tual contents expressed by the old vocabulary, it must be a crite -  rion of adequacy for introducing logical vocabulary that no new  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism   6 9  inferences involving only the old vocabulary be made appropriate thereby.  XI.   ‘Boche’ and the Elucidation o f  Inferential Commitment s  The problem of what Dummett calls a lack of “harmony” between the circumstances and the consequences of application of a con -  cept may arise for concepts with material contents, however. See -  ing how it does provides further help in understanding the notion of expressive rationality, and the way in which the explicitating role of logical vocabulary contributes to the clarification of con -  cepts. For conceptual change can be  motivated by the desire to attain or preserve a harmony between the two aspects of an expression’s meaning. A simple case would be that of a pejorative term, e.g. ‘Boche’. The conditions for applying the term to someone is that he is of German national -  ity; the consequences of its application are that he is barbarous and more prone to cruelty than other Europeans. We should envisage the connections in both directions as sufficiently tight as to be involved in the very meaning of the word: neither could be severed without altering its meaning. Someone who rejects the word does so because he does not want to permit a transition from the grounds for applying the term to the consequences of doing so. The addition of the term ‘Boche’ to a language which did not previously contain it would produce a non-conservative extension, i.e. one in which certain other statements which did not contain the term were inferable from other statements not containing it which were not previously inferable. 20  This crucial passage makes a number of points that are worth untangling. First of all, it shows how concepts can be criticized on the basis of substantive beliefs. If one does not believe that the inference from German nationality to cruelty is a good one, one  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n7 0   ◆   Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism  must eschew the concept or expression ‘Boche’. For one cannot deny that there are any Boche—that is just denying that anyone is German, which is patently false. One cannot admit that there are Boche and deny that they are cruel—that is just attempting to take back with one claim what one has committed oneself to with an -  other. One can only refuse to employ the concept, on the grounds that it embodies an inference one does not endorse.  I have been told (by Jonathan Bennett) that the prosecutor at Oscar Wilde’s trial at one point read out some of the more hair -  raising passages from   The Importance of Being Earnest   and said, “I put it to you, Mr. Wilde, that this is   blasphemy.   Is it or is it not?” Wilde made exactly the reply he ought to make—indeed, the only one he could make—given the considerations being presented here and the circumstances and consequences of application of the concept in question. He said, “Sir, ‘blasphemy’ is not one of my words.”  Highly charged words such as ‘nigger’, ‘whore’, ‘faggot’, ‘lady’, ‘Communist’, ‘Republican’ have seemed to some a special case because they couple ‘descriptive’ circumstances of application to ‘evaluative’ consequences. But this is not the only sort of expres -  sion embodying inferences that requires close scrutiny. The use of any concept or expression involves commitment to an inference from its grounds to its consequences of application. Critical thinkers, or merely fastidious ones, must examine their idioms to be sure that they are prepared to endorse and so defend the appro -  priateness of the material inferential transitions implicit in the concepts they employ. In Reason’s fight against thought debased by prejudice and propaganda, the first rule is that potentially con -  troversial material inferential commitments should be made ex -  plicit as claims, exposing them both as vulnerable to reasoned challenge and as in need of reasoned defense. They must not be allowed to remain curled up inside loaded phrases such as ‘enemy of the people’ or ‘law and order’.  It is in this process that formal logical vocabulary such as the  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism   7 1  conditional plays its explicitating role. It permits the formulation, as explicit claims, of the inferential commitments that otherwise remain implicit and unexamined in the contents of material con -  cepts. Logical locutions make it possible to display the relevant grounds and consequences and to assert their inferential relation. Formulating as an explicit claim the inferential commitment implicit in the content brings it out into the open as liable to chal -  lenges and demands for justification, just as with any assertion. In this way explicit expression plays an elucidating role, functioning to groom and improve our inferential commitments, and so our conceptual contents—a role, in short, in the practices of reflective rationality or ‘Socratic method’.  But if Dummett is suggesting that what is wrong with the con -  cept   Boche   (or   nigger ) is that its addition represents a nonconserv -  ative extension of the rest of the language, he is mistaken. Its non -  conservativeness just shows that it has a substantive content, in that it implicitly involves a material inference that is not already implicit in the contents of other concepts being employed. Out -  side of logic, this is no bad thing. Conceptual progress in science often consists in introducing just such novel contents. The con -  cept of temperature was introduced with certain criteria or cir -  cumstances of appropriate application, and certain consequences of application. As new ways of measuring temperature are intro -  duced, and new theoretical and practical consequences of temper -  ature measurements adopted, the complex inferential commit -  ment that determines the significance of using the concept of temperature evolves.  The proper question to ask in evaluating the introduction and evolution of a concept is not whether the inference embodied is one that is already endorsed, so that no new content is really involved, but rather whether that inference is one that   ought   to be endorsed. The problem with ‘Boche’ or ‘nigger’ is not that once we explicitly confront the material inferential commitment that gives the term its content it turns out to be novel, but that it can  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n7 2   ◆   Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism  then be seen to be indefensible and inappropriate—a commitment we cannot become entitled to. We want to be aware of the infer -  ential commitments our concepts involve, to be able to make them explicit, and to be able to justify them. But there are other ways of justifying them than showing that we were already implic -  itly committed to them before introducing or altering the concept in question.  XII.   Harmony and Material Inference  Even in the cases where it does make sense to identify harmony of circumstances and consequences with inferential conservative -  ness, the attribution of conservativeness is always relative to a background set of material inferential practices, the ones that are conservatively extended by the vocabulary in question. Conserva -  tiveness is a property of the conceptual content only in the context of other contents, not something it has by itself. Thus there can be pairs of logical connectives, either of which is all right by itself, but both of which cannot be included in a consistent system. It is a peculiar ideal of harmony that would be realized by a system of conceptual contents such that the material inferences implicit in every subset of concepts represented a conservative extension of the remaining concepts, in that no inferences involving only the remaining ones are licensed that are not licensed already by the contents associated just with those remaining concepts. Such a system is an idealization, because all of its concepts would already be out in the open; none remaining hidden, to be revealed only by drawing conclusions from premises that have never been con -  joined before, following out unexplored lines of reasoning, draw -  ing consequences one was not previously aware one would be entitled or committed to by some set of premises. In short, this would be a case where Socratic reflection, making implicit com -  mitments explicit and examining their consequences and possible justifications, would never motivate one to alter contents or com-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism   7 3  mitments. Such complete transparency of commitment and enti -  tlement is in some sense an ideal projected by the sort of Socratic practice that finds current contents and commitments wanting by confronting them with one another, pointing out inferential fea -  tures of each of which we were unaware. But as Wittgenstein teaches in general, it should not be assumed that our scheme is like this, or depends on an underlying set of contents like this, just because we are obliged to remove any particular ways in which we discover it to fall short.  These are reasons to part company with the suggestion, for -  warded in the passage above, that inferential conservatism is a nec -  essary condition of a ‘harmonious’ concept—one that will not ‘tonk up’ a conceptual scheme. In a footnote, Dummett explicitly denies that conservativeness can in general be treated as a suffi -  cient condition of harmony: “This is not to say that the character of the harmony demanded is always easy to explain, or that it can always be accounted for in terms of the notion of a conservative extension . . . [T]he most difficult case is probably the vexed prob -  lem of personal identity.” 21   In another place, this remark about personal identity is laid out in more detail:  We have reasonably sharp criteria which we apply in ordinary cases for deciding questions of personal identity: and there are also fairly clear consequences attaching to the settlement of such a question one way or the other, namely those relating to ascrip -  tions of responsibility, both moral and legal, to the rights and obligations which a person has . . . What is much harder is to give an account of the connection between the criteria for the truth of a statement of personal identity and the consequences of accepting it. We can easily imagine people who use different cri -  teria from ours . . . Precisely what would make the criteria they used criteria for personal identity would lie in their attaching the same consequence, in regard to responsibility, motivation, etc., to their statements of personal identity as we do to ours. If there  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n7 4   ◆   Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism  existed a clear method for deriving, as it were, the consequences of a statement from the criteria for its truth, then the difference between such people and ourselves would have the character of a factual disagreement, and one side would be able to show the other to be wrong. If there were no connection between truth -  grounds and consequences, then the disagreement between us would lie merely in a preference for different concepts, and there would be no right or wrong in the matter at all. 22  Dummett thinks that there is a general problem concerning the way in which the circumstances and consequences of application of expressions or concepts ought to fit together. Some sort of ‘harmony’ seems to be required between these two aspects of the use. The puzzling thing, he seems to be saying, is that the har -  mony required cannot happily be assimilated either to compulsion by facts or to the dictates of freely chosen meanings. But the options—matter of fact or relation of ideas, expression of commit -  ment as belief or expression of commitment as meaning—are not ones that readers of “Two Dogmas of Empiricism” ought to be tempted to treat as exhaustive.  The notion of a completely factual issue that Dummett appeals to in this passage is one in which the applicability of a concept is settled straightforwardly by the application of other concepts— the concepts that specify the necessary and sufficient conditions that determine the truth conditions of claims involving the origi -  nal concept. This conception, envisaged by a model of conceptual content as necessary and sufficient conditions, seems to require a conceptual scheme that is ideally transparent in the way men -  tioned above, in that it is immune to Socratic criticism. For that conception insists that these coincide in that the jointly sufficient conditions already entail the individually necessary ones, so that it is attractive to talk about content as truth conditions rather than focusing on the substantive inferential commitments that relate the sufficient to the distinct necessary conditions, as recom -  mended here. By contrast to this either/or, in a picture according  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism   7 5  to which conceptual contents are conferred on expressions by their being caught up in a structure of inferentially articulated commitments and entitlements, material inferential commitments are a necessary part of any package of practices that includes mate -  rial doxastic commitments.  The circumstances and consequences of application of a non -  logical concept may stand in a substantive material inferential re -  lation. To ask what sort of ‘harmony’ they should exhibit is to ask what material inferences we ought to endorse, and so what conceptual contents we ought to employ. This is not the sort of question to which we ought to expect or welcome a general or wholesale answer. Grooming our concepts and material inferential commitments in the light of our assertional commitments, includ -  ing those we find ourselves with noninferentially through obser -  vation, and the latter in the light of the former, is a messy, retail business.  Dummett thinks that a theory of meaning should take the form of an account of the nature of the ‘harmony’ that ought to obtain between the circumstances and the consequences of application of the concepts we ought to employ. If we shift our concern up a level now, to apply these considerations about the relations of cir -  cumstances to consequences of application to the contents of the concepts employed in the metalanguage in which we couch a semantic theory, the important point would be that we should not expect a theory of that sort to take the form of a specification of necessary and sufficient conditions for the circumstances and con -  sequences of application of a concept to be harmonious. For that presupposes that the circumstances and consequences of applica -  tion of the concept of   harmony   do not themselves stand in a sub -  stantive material inferential relation. On the contrary, insofar as the idea of a theory of semantic or inferential harmony makes sense at all, it must take the form of an investigation of the ongo -  ing elucidative process, of the ‘Socratic method’ of discovering and repairing discordant concepts, which alone gives the notion of harmony any content. It is given content only by the process of  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n7 6   ◆   Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism  harmonizing commitments, from which it is abstracted. In Sell -  ars’s characterization of expressive rationality, modal claims are assigned the expressive role of inference licenses, which make explicit a commitment that is implicit in the use of conceptual contents antecedently in play. Rules of this sort assert an authority over future practice, and answer for their entitlement both to the prior practice being codified and to concomitant inferential and doxastic commitments. In this way they may be likened to the principles formulated by judges at common law, intended both to codify prior practice, as represented by precedent, expressing explicitly as a rule what was implicit therein, and to have regulative authority for subsequent practice. The expressive task of making material inferential commitments explicit plays an essential role in the reflectively rational Socratic practice of harmonizing our com -  mitments. For a commitment to become explicit is for it to be thrown into the game of giving and asking for reasons as some -  thing whose justification, in terms of other commitments and entitlements, is liable to question. Any theory of the sort of infer -  ential harmony of commitments we are aiming at by engaging in this reflective, rational process must derive its credentials from its expressive adequacy to that practice before it should be accorded any authority over it.  XIII.   From Semantics to Pragmatics  In the first part of this chapter I introduced three related ideas:  the   inferential   understanding of conceptual content;  the idea of   materially   good inferences; and  the idea of   expressive   rationality.  These contrast, respectively, with  an understanding of content exclusively according to the model of the   representation   of states of affairs (I think I have man-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism   7 7  aged to say rather a lot about conceptual content in this essay, without talking at all about what is represented by such con -  tents);  an understanding of the goodness of inference exclusively on the model of   formal   validity; and an understanding of rationality exclusively on the model of  instrumental   or means-end reasoning.  In the second part of the chapter these ideas were considered in relation to the representation of inferential role suggested by Dummett, in terms of the circumstances of appropriate applica -  tion of an expression or concept and the appropriate conse -  quences of such application. It is in the context of these ideas that I have sought to present an   expressive   view of the role of logic and its relation to the practices constitutive of rationality. That view holds out the hope of recovering for the study of   logic   a direct sig -  nificance for projects that have been at the core of   philosophy   since its Socratic inception.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\nCopyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆   ◆   ◆  TW O  Action, Norms, an d  Practical Reasonin g  I.   Some Background  In this chapter I aim to do three things, corresponding to the three elements of my title:  To explain the expressive role that distinguishes specifically   nor -  mative   vocabulary. That is, to say what it is the job of such vocabulary to make explicit. Doing this is saying what ‘ought’ means.  To introduce a non-Humean way of thinking about   practical reasoning.  To offer a broadly Kantian account of the   will   as a rational fac -  ulty of practical reasoning.  The idea is to do that by exploiting the structural analogies between discursive exit transitions in action and discursive entry transitions in perception to show how the rational will can be understood   as   no   more   philosophically   mysterious   than   our capacity to notice red things.  Practical reasoning often leads to action, so it is clear that there is an intimate connection between these two elements of my title. But one might wonder: why action and   norms?   Let me start with some background. The beginning of wisdom in thinking about  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n8 0   ◆   Action, Norms, and Practical Reasoning  these matters (as for so many others) is to look to Kant: the great, gray mother of us all. For we are in the privileged position of being downstream from the fundamental conceptual sea change effected by the replacement of concern with Cartesian certainty by concern with Kantian necessity—that is, of concern with our grip on concepts (Is it clear? Is it distinct?) by concern with their grip on us (Is this rule binding on us? Is it applicable to this case?). Kant’s big idea is that what distinguishes judgment and action from the responses of merely natural creatures is neither their rela -  tion to some special stuff nor their peculiar transparency, but rather that they are what we are in a distinctive way   responsible   for. They express   commitments   of ours: commitments that we are answerable for in the sense that our   entitlement   to them is always potentially at issue; commitments that are   rational   in the sense that vindicating the corresponding entitlements is a matter of offering   reasons   for them.  Another big idea of Kant’s—seeing the   judgment   as the smallest unit of experience—is a consequence of the first one. The logic he inherited started with a doctrine of   terms,   divided into the singular and the general, proceeded to a doctrine of   judgment   (understood in terms of predicating a general term of a singular one), and thence to a doctrine of   consequences   or inferences. Kant starts with judgment because that is the smallest unit for which we can be  responsible.   (This thought is taken over by Frege, who begins with the units to which pragmatic force can attach, and Wittgenstein, who looks at the smallest expressions whose utterance makes a move in the language game.) It is under this rubric that judgment is assimilated to action. A third Kantian idea is then to understand both judgment and action as the application of   concepts.   He does that by understanding concepts as the   rules   that determine what knowers and agents are responsible   for —what they have commit -  ted themselves to.  I discuss the topics of my title—action, norms, and practical reasoning—in the idiom I developed in my book   Making It  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Action, Norms, and Practical Reasoning   8 1  Explicit. 1   To begin with, I work within the context of what I call there a   normative pragmatics.   Specifically, I think of discursive practice as deontic scorekeeping: the significance of a speech act is how it changes what commitments and entitlements one attrib -  utes and acknowledges. I work also within the context of an   infer -  ential semantics.   That is, discursive commitments (to begin with, doxastic ones) are distinguished by their specifically inferential articulation: what counts as evidence for them, what else they commit us to, what other commitments they are incompatible with in the sense of precluding entitlement to. This is a reading of what it is for the norms in question to be specifically   conceptual  norms. The overall idea is that the rationality that qualifies us as  sapients   (and not merely sentients) can be identified with being a player in the social, implicitly normative game of offering and assessing, producing and consuming, reasons.  I further endorse an   expressive   view of   logic.   That is, I see the characteristic role that distinguishes specifically logical vocabulary as being making explicit, in the form of a claim, features of the game of giving and asking for reasons in virtue of which bits of  non logical vocabulary play the roles that they do. The paradigm is the   conditional.   Before introducing this locution, one can   do  something, namely, endorse an inference. After introducing the conditional, one can now   say   that the inference is a good one. The expressive role of the conditional is to make   explicit,   in the form of a claim, what before was   implicit   in our practice of distinguishing some inferences as good.  Giving and asking for reasons for   actions   is possible only in the context of practices of giving and asking for reasons generally— that is, of practices of making and defending   claims   or   judgments.  For giving a reason is always expressing a judgment: making a claim. So practical reasoning requires the availability of beliefs (doxastic commitments) as premises. On the side of the   consequences   of acquisition of practical deontic statuses, it appears in the essential role that propositional (assertible) contents play in specifying  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n8 2   ◆   Action, Norms, and Practical Reasoning  conditions of   success:   that is, what would count as fulfilling a com -  mitment to act. Forming an intention (undertaking a commit -  ment) to put a ball through a hoop requires knowing what it is to put a ball through a hoop—what must be   true   for that intention to   succeed.   This is a point about explanatory   autonomy:   I claim that one can explain the role of beliefs in theoretical reasoning (leading from claims to claims) without needing to appeal to prac -  tical reasoning, while I do not believe that one can do things in the opposite order.  II.   The Approach  The treatment of action I am sketching is motivated by three truisms, and two more interesting ideas. First, beliefs make a dif -  ference both to what we   say   and to what we   do.   We license others to infer our beliefs (or, as I will say, our doxastic commitments) both from our explicit claims and from our overt intentional actions. Next is a (by now familiar) lesson we have been taught by Anscombe and Davidson. 2   Actions are performances that are intentional under some specification. 3   Such performances can genuinely be things   done   even though they have many specifica -  tions under which they are   not   intentional. Thus, alerting the bur -  glar by flipping the switch was an action of mine, even though I did not intend to do that, because flipping the switch has another description, namely, “turning on the lights,” under which it   was  intentional. A third, companion idea is that at least one way a specification of a performance can be privileged as one under which it is intentional is by figuring as the conclusion of a piece of practical reasoning that exhibits the agent’s reasons for producing that performance.  Davidson’s original idea was to eliminate   intentions   in favor of primary   reasons,   understood in terms of   beliefs   and   pro-attitudes  (paradigmatically,   desires ). My first idea is to start instead with normative statuses and attitudes corresponding to   beliefs   and  intentions.   I will try to explain   desires,   and, more generally, the  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Action, Norms, and Practical Reasoning   8 3  pro-attitudes expressed by   normative   vocabulary, in terms of those beliefs and intentions. The thought is that there are two species of discursive commitment: the cognitive (or doxastic) and the practical. The latter are commitments to   act.   Acknowledg -  ments of the first sort of commitment correspond to   beliefs;  acknowledgments of the second sort of commitment correspond to   intentions.   The first are takings-true, the second makings-true. Practical commitments are like doxastic commitments in being essentially inferentially articulated. They stand in inferential rela -  tions both among themselves (both means-end and incompatibil -  ity) and to doxastic commitments.  The second basic idea motivating the present account is that the noninferential relations between acknowledgments of practical commitments and states of affairs brought about by intentional  action   can be understood by analogy to the noninferential rela -  tions between acknowledgments of doxastic commitments and the states of affairs they are brought about by through conceptu -  ally contentful   perception.  1 .   Observation (a discursive   entry   transition) depends on reli -  able dispositions to respond differentially to states of affairs of various kinds by acknowledging certain sorts of commit -  ments, that is, by adopting deontic attitudes and so changing the score.  2 .   Action (a discursive   exit   transition) depends on reliable dispo -  sitions to respond differentially to the acknowledging of cer -  tain sorts of commitments, the adoption of deontic attitudes and consequent change of score, by bringing about various kinds of states of affairs.  Elaborating the first idea (modeling intention on belief as cor -  responding to inferentially articulated commitments) involves examining the sense in which practical reasons are   reasons;   elabo -  rating the second idea (modeling action on perception, discursive exits on discursive entries) involves examining the sense in which practical reasons are   causes.   It is this latter idea that makes sense of  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n8 4   ◆   Action, Norms, and Practical Reasoning  the distinction, so crucial to Davidson, between acting   for   a rea -  son and merely acting   with   a reason.  Put in terms of the deontic scorekeeping model of discursive practice, the idea is that   intentions   are to   reasons   as   commitments  are to   entitlements.   It follows that on this model, Davidson would be wrong to say that “someone who acts with a certain intention acts for a reason.” For just as one can undertake doxastic or theo -  retical commitments to which one is not entitled by reasons, so one can undertake practical commitments to which one is not entitled by reasons. What makes a performance an   action   is that it is, or is produced by the exercise of a reliable differential disposi -  tion to respond to, the acknowledgment of a practical commit -  ment. That acknowledgment need not itself have been produced as a response to the acknowledgment of other commitments infer -  entially related to it as entitlement-conferring reasons (though that it   could   be so elicited   is   essential to its being the acknowledg -  ment of a practical commitment).  III.   Three Patterns of Practical Reasoning  The strategy of trying to understand desires, and the pro-attitudes expressed by normative vocabulary more generally, in terms of their relation to beliefs and intentions—instead of the more orthodox Humean and Davidsonian strategy of starting with beliefs and desires—requires thinking about practical reasoning somewhat differently. Consider the following three bits of practi -  cal reasoning:  α . Only opening my umbrella will keep me dry, so I shall open my umbrella.  β . I am a bank employee going to work, so I shall wear a necktie.  γ . Repeating the gossip would harm someone, to no purpose, so I shall not repeat the gossip.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Action, Norms, and Practical Reasoning   8 5  ‘Shall’ is used here to express the significance of the conclusion as the acknowledging of a practical commitment. (‘Will’ would be used correspondingly to express a doxastic commitment to a pre -  diction.)  The Davidsonian approach treats these as enthymemes, whose missing premises might be filled in by something like:  a.   I want (desire, prefer) to stay dry.  b.   Bank employees are obliged (required) to wear neckties.  c.   It is wrong (one ought not) to harm anyone to no purpose.  (Orthodox contemporary Humeans would insist that something is missing in the second two cases, even when [b] and [c] are sup -  plied. More on that thought later.) This enthymematic thesis is parallel on the side of practical reasoning to the insistence that theoretical reasoning be   s completed s4   by the addition of condi -  tionals, which assert the propriety of the material inferences involved, and transform the move into something that is   formally  valid. Sellars teaches us that that move is optional. We need not treat all correct inferences as correct in virtue of their form, sup -  plying implicit or suppressed premises involving logical vocabu -  lary as needed. Instead, we can treat inferences such as that from “Pittsburgh is to the west of Philadelphia” to “Philadelphia is to the east of Pittsburgh,” or from “It is raining” to “The streets will be wet,” as   materially   good inferences—that is, inferences that are good because of the content of their   non logical vocabulary. 5   I propose to adopt this nonformalist strategy in thinking about practical inferences.  One reason to do so was pointed out in the previous chapter: the notion of   formally valid   inferences is definable in a natural way from the notion of   materially correct   ones. The idea is to pick out some special subset of the vocabulary, and to observe features of inference that remain invariant when all other vocabulary is substi -  tuted for. In this way, the privileged vocabulary that is held fixed  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n8 6   ◆   Action, Norms, and Practical Reasoning  defines a notion of   form.   An inference is good in virtue of its form in this sense just in case it is a materially good inference and no materially bad inference results from it by substitutional transfor -  mations corresponding to replacing nonprivileged by nonprivi -  leged vocabulary. If the form-defining fixed vocabulary is   logical  vocabulary, then the inferences whose propriety remains robust under such substitution are good in virtue of their   logical   form. On this substitutional approach, the notion of   logically   good inferences is explained in terms of a prior notion of   materially  good ones.  This account contrasts with the standard order of explanation, which treats all inferences as good or bad solely in virtue of their form, with the contents of the claims they involve mattering only for the truth of the (implicit) premises. According to this way of setting things out, there is no such thing as material inference. This view, which understands ‘good inference’ to mean ‘formally valid inference’, postulating implicit premises as needed, might be called a   formalist   approach to inference. It trades primitive good -  nesses of inference for the truth of conditionals. I am not claiming that one   cannot   decide to talk this way. The point is just that one  need   not.  If one rejects the formalist order of explanation, what should one say about the role of conditional claims, such as “ If   Pitts -  burgh is to the west of Princeton,   then   Princeton is to the east of Pittsburgh”? The claim is that although such conditionals need not be added as explicit premises in order to license the inference from their antecedents to their consequents, they nonetheless serve to make explicit—in the form of a claim—the otherwise merely implicit endorsement of a material propriety of inference. Before we have conditionals on board, we can   do   something, namely, treat certain material inferences as correct. Once we have the expressive power of those logical locutions, we come to be able to   say that   they are good. The expressivist line about logic sees conditionals as making implicit material inferential commit-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\nI want to treat  A.   It is raining  ∴   I shall open my umbrella.  as like  B.   It is raining  ◆  Action, Norms, and Practical Reasoning   8 7  ments explicit, in the form of claims—but as   not   required to make the inferences they explicitate   good   inferences. Indeed, on this view, playing such an explicitating expressive role is precisely what distinguishes some vocabulary as distinctively   logical.  IV.   Material Properties of Practical Reasoning  ∴   The streets will be wet .  and say that   neither   one is an enthymeme .  The Davidsonian will respond that we can see that the reason offered in the first case is incomplete, because the inference would not go through if I did not want to stay dry. But I think that what we really know is rather that the inference would not go through if I had a   contrary   desire: say, the Gene Kelly desire to sing and dance in the rain, and so to get wet. But the fact that conjoining a premise incompatible with the desire to stay dry would infirm the inference (turn it into a bad one) does not show that the desire was all along already functioning as an implicit premise. There would be a case for that conclusion only if the reasoning involved were   monotonic —that is, if the fact that the inference from   p   to   q   is a good one meant that the inference from   p   &   r   to   q   must be a good one. (So that the fact that the latter is   not   a good argument settled it that the former is not either.)  But material inference is not in general monotonic—even on the theoretical side. It can be in special cases, say, in mathematics  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n8 8   ◆   Action, Norms, and Practical Reasoning  and fundamental physics. But it never is in ordinary reasoning, and almost never in the special sciences. (Reasoning in clinical medicine, for instance, is resolutely nonmonotonic.) Consider the arguments that are codified in the following conditionals:  1 .   If I strike this dry, well-made match, then it will light. ( p   →   q )  2 .   If   p   and the match is in a very strong electromagnetic field, then it will   not   light. ( p   &   r   →   ~ q )  3 .   If   p   and   r   and the match is in a Faraday cage, then it will light. ( p   &   r   &   s   →   q )  4 .   If   p   and   r   and   s   and the room is evacuated of oxygen, then it will   not   light. ( p   &   r   &   s   &   t   →   ~ q )  The reasoning we actually engage in always permits the construc -  tion of inferential hierarchies with oscillating conclusions like this. A certain kind of formalist about logic will want to insist, for rea -  sons of high theory, that material inference   must   be like formal inference in being monotonic. And at this point in the dialectic, such a   monotonous formalist   will invoke   ceteris paribus   clauses. I do not want to claim that invoking such clauses (“all other things being equal”) is incoherent or silly. But we must be careful how we understand the expressive role they play. For they cannot (I want to say, “in principle”) be cashed out; their content cannot be made explicit in the form of a series of additional premises. They are not shorthand for something we   could   say if we took the time or the trouble. The problem is not just that we would need an  infinite   list of the conditions being ruled out—though that is true. It is that the membership of such a list would be   indefinite:   we do not know how to specify in advance what belongs on the list. If we try to solve this problem by a   general   characterization, we get something equivalent to: “ ceteris paribus, q   follows from   p ” means that “ q   follows from   p   unless there is some   infirming   or   interfer -  ing   condition.” But this is just to say that   q   follows from   p   except in the cases where for some reason it doesn’t.  I would contend that   ceteris paribus   clauses should be under -  stood as explicitly marking the nonmonotonicity of an inference,  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Action, Norms, and Practical Reasoning   8 9  rather than as a deus ex machina that magically   removes   its nonmo -  notonicity. The material inference ( 1 ) above is just fine as it stands. But if one wants explicitly to acknowledge that, even so, it can form the base of an oscillating hierarchy of inferences of the form of inference ( 2 ), ( 3 ), ( 4 ), and so on, then one can do so by refor -  mulating it as  1   ′ .   If I strike this dry, well-made match, then   ceteris paribus   it will light.  Like their theoretical brethren, material proprieties of   practical  reasoning are nonmonotonic. So the fact that if I add “I want to get wet” as a second premise to inference (A) above, the resulting inference no longer goes through (that is, would be a bad one) does   not   show that the   denial   of that premise was already implicit. That would be the case only if material practical inferences were monotonic. For this reason, and to this extent, I am inclined to think that the sort of reductive Humeanism about practical rea -  soning (about which more below) that recommends rational choice theory as an overarching theory of reasons generally is based on a mistaken philosophy of logic. In any case, as we will see, there is another way to go. We could think of the expressive role of avowals of desire as being analogous, on the practical side, to that of the conditional on the theoretical side: not as function -  ing as a   premise,   but as making explicit the   inferential   commit -  ment that permits the transition.  V.   The Expressive Role of Normative Vocabulary  With this background, I can state my fundamental thesis:   norma -  tive vocabulary   (including expressions of preference)   makes explicit the endorsement (attributed or acknowledged) of  materia l   proprieties of   practica l   reasoning.   Normative vocabu -  lary plays the same expressive role on the   practical   side that   condi -  tionals   do on the   theoretical   side.  The idea is that the broadly normative or evaluative vocabulary  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n9 0   ◆   Action, Norms, and Practical Reasoning  used in (a), (b), and (c) (‘prefer’, ‘obliged’, and ‘ought’)—which Davidson understands as expressing the pro-attitudes needed to turn the incomplete reasons offered as premises in ( α ), ( β ), and ( γ ) into complete reasons—is used to make explicit in assertible, propo -  sitional form the endorsement of a   pattern   of material practical inferences. Different patterns of inference should be understood as corresponding to different sorts of norms or pro-attitudes.  For instance, an attributor who takes ( α ) to be entitlement -  preserving will also take  a ′ . Only standing under the awning will keep me dry, so I shall stand under the awning. a ″ . Only remaining in the car will keep me dry, so I shall remain in the car.  and a host of similar inferences to have that status. Doing so is implicitly attributing a preference for staying dry. (Notice that because desires can compete, they provide only prima facie rea -  sons for acting. Acknowledging the nonmonotonicity of practical reasoning, however, already provides for the features of reasoning that are normally dealt with by introducing such a notion.)  The norm, rule, or requirement that bank employees wear neckties is what makes going to work into a reason for wearing a necktie for bank employees. Taking it that there is such a norm or requirement also just is endorsing a pattern of practical reasoning: taking ( β ) to be a good inference for anyone who is a bank employee. This inferential pattern is different from that exhibited by ( α ) in two ways. First, there need not be for each interlocutor for whom ( β ) is taken to be a good inference a set of other infer -  ences corresponding to ( α ), ( α″ ), ( α′ ). Instead, there will be related inferences such as  b ′ . I am a bank employee going to work, so I shall not wear a clown costume. b ″ . I am a bank employee going to work, so I shall comb my hair.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Action, Norms, and Practical Reasoning   9 1  But these are licensed not by the norm made explicit in (b), but only by others associated with the same social institutional status (being a bank employee).  Second, the scorekeeper will take ( β ) to be a good inference for any interlocutor   A   such that the scorekeeper   undertakes   dox -  astic commitment to the claim that   A   is a bank employee—as opposed to   attributing   a desire or acknowledgment of a commit -  ment. Here the norm implicitly underwriting the inference is associated with having a certain status, as employee of a bank, rather than with exhibiting a certain desire or preference. Whether one has a good reason to wear a necktie just depends on whether or not one occupies the status in question. This pattern, where what matters is the scorekeeper’s undertaking of a commitment to  A ’s occupying the status rather than   A ’s acknowledgment of that commitment, corresponds to an   objective   sense of ‘good reason for action’ (according to the scorekeeper). In this sense, that   A  is preparing to go to work can be a good reason for   A   to wear a necktie, even though   A   is not in a position to appreciate it as such. (Compare the sense in which one’s reliability as a reporter can entitle one to a claim—in the eyes of a scorekeeper—even if one is not aware that one is reliable, and so not aware of one’s entitlement.)  Endorsement of practical reasoning of the sort of which ( γ ) is representative, codified in the form of a normative principle by (c), corresponds to an inferential commitment exhibiting a pat -  tern different from those involved in either ( α ) or ( β ). For a score -  keeper who takes ( γ ) to be entitlement-preserving for   A   takes it to be entitlement-preserving for   anyone,   regardless of desires or pref -  erences, and regardless of social status.  These   prudential   (or instrumental),   institutional,   and   uncondi -  tional   norms (made explicit by corresponding ‘ought’s) are meant only as three representative varieties, not as an exhaustive list. But they show how different sorts of norms correspond to differ -  ent patterns of practical reasoning. The idea is that normative vocabulary is a kind of   logical   vocabulary, in my expressive sense:  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n9 2   ◆   Action, Norms, and Practical Reasoning  its expressive function is to make explicit commitments to in -  ferences.  To endorse a practical inference as entitlement-preserving is to take the doxastic premises as providing reasons for the practical conclusion. To exhibit a piece of good practical reasoning whose conclusion is a certain intention is to exhibit that intention, and the action (if any) that it elicits, as   rational,   as reasonable in the light of the commitments exhibited in the premises. Thus   all   of the ‘ought’s that make explicit species of practical reasoning taken as examples here, the prudential ‘ought’, the institutional ‘ought’, and the unconditional ‘ought’, are different kinds of   rational  ‘ought’. There is no a priori reason to assimilate all such ‘ought’s to any one form—for instance, the prudential (Humean totalitari -  anism), as rationality-as-maximizing theorists (such as Gauthier) do. Recall also that the entitlement provided by prudential or institutional reasons need   not   be endorsed by the attributor; as Davidson points out, we need not take the agent’s reasons to be  good   reasons.  From the point of view of this botanization of patterns of prac -  tical reasoning (which I do not pretend is complete), the humean and the kantian both have too restricted a notion of reasons for action. Each pursues a Procrustean order of explanation:  The humean assimilates all reasons for action to the   first   pat -  tern. Thus the humean will see the inferences like ( β ) and  ( γ ) as incomplete, even with the addition of premises (b)  and (c).  The kantian assimilates all reasons for action to the   third   pattern.  The humean denies that a mere obligation or commitment could provide a reason for action, unless accompanied by some desire to fulfill it. And the kantian denies that a mere desire   (sinnliche Neigung)   could provide a reason for action, unless accompanied by the acknowledgment of some corresponding obligation or commitment.

The Rational Will  A picture of the rational will emerges if we combine these three ideas:  the belief model of intending—the idea of modeling practical commitments on doxastic ones; the picture of practical reasoning as relating beliefs as premises to intentions as conclusions; and the modeling of actions as discursive exit transitions on percep -  tions as discursive entry transitions  It is important to remember to begin with acknowledging that a practical commitment is understood on the model   not   of   prom -  ising   but of   claiming. 6   In particular, the commitment is not   to  anyone in particular, and one can change one’s mind anytime, essentially without penalty. In both these respects, the practical commitments that correspond to intentions are like doxastic com -  mitments rather than like promises. But while commitment   is   in force, it has consequences: for other practical commitments (and hence entitlements to practical commitments), via means-end rea -  soning and consideration of practical incompatibilities, and for doxastic commitments (and hence entitlement to doxastic com -  mitments). Scorekeepers are licensed to infer our beliefs from our intentional actions (in context of course), as well as from our speech acts.  Acting with reasons is being   entitled   to one’s practical commit -  ments. Having this status is being intelligible to oneself and to others. This status can be vindicated by offering a suitable sample piece of practical reasoning (which need not actually have pre -  ceded the acknowledgment or performance in question). That piece of practical reasoning explains   why   one did as one did: what  reasons   one had. This means that in particular cases one can act intentionally but without reasons. But the capacity to acknowledge propositionally contentful practical commitments will be attrib -  uted only to those whose performances are largely intelligible.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n9 4   ◆   Action, Norms, and Practical Reasoning  The modeling of action on perception registers the crucial fact that acknowledgments of commitments can cause and be caused. Kant defines the rational will as the capacity to derive perfor -  mances from conceptions of laws. 7   I am suggesting that we can replace “conception of a law” in this formulation by “acknowl -  edgment of a commitment.” “Law” is Kant’s term for a binding rule—a norm. One’s conception of a law is what one takes oneself to be obliged to do. Having a rational will, then, can be under -  stood as having the capacity to respond reliably to one’s acknowl -  edgment of a commitment (of a norm as binding on one) by differentially producing performances corresponding to the con -  tent of the commitment acknowledged. But perception is strictly analogous on the input side. It is a capacity to respond differen -  tially to the presence of, say, red things, by acknowledging a com -  mitment with a corresponding content. The one capacity should in principle appear as no more mysterious than the other. Accord -  ing to this picture, we are rational creatures exactly insofar as our acknowledgment of discursive commitments (both doxastic and practical) makes a difference to what we go on to   do.  Prior   intentions are acknowledgments of practical commit -  ments that are distinct from and antecedent to the responsive per -  formances they are reliably differentially disposed to elicit. In other cases (intentions-in-action) the production of the perfor -  mance may   be   the acknowledgment of the practical commitment. Prior intentions involve practical commitments to produce per -  formances meeting   general   descriptions. Intentions-in-action are acknowledgments of practical commitments consisting of perfor -  mances that are intentional under   demonstrative   specifications (e.g., “I shall jump   now ”). (These are Sellars’s ‘volitions’—“prior intentions whose time has come” 8 —a category rescued from the mistake of conceiving   tryings   as minimal   actions   that are safe in that they preclude the possibility of   failure,   just as, and for the same reasons,   seemings   are conceived as minimal   knowings   that are safe in that they preclude the possibility of   error. ) 9   One is a reliable  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Action, Norms, and Practical Reasoning   9 5  agent (compare: reliable perceiver) with respect to a range of cir -  cumstances and a range of contents of practical commitments when one is so disposed that under those circumstances one’s prior intentions with those contents conditionally   mature   into corresponding intentions-in-action.  One nice feature of this story is that what is expressed by the normative ‘should’ is related to what is expressed by the inten -  tional ‘shall’ as third-person usage to first-person usage—that is, as attributing practical commitments (to others) is related to acknowledging practical commitments (oneself ). The use of nor -  mative vocabulary such as ‘should’ expresses the attribution to an agent of commitment to a pattern of practical reasoning, while the use of ‘shall’ expresses acknowledgment by the agent of the sort of practical commitment that can appear as the conclusion of such practical reasoning. It is those acknowledgments that in compe -  tent agents are keyed to the production of the corresponding per -  formances under favorable conditions. This relationship provides a way to make sense of weakness of the will ( akrasia ). For that phenomenon arises when self- attributions   of practical commit -  ments (which would be made explicit by statements of the form “I  should   . . .”) do not have the causal significance of   acknowledg -  ments   of practical commitments (which would be made explicit by statements of the form “I   shall   . . .”). In this form, the possibility of incompatible intentions is no more mysterious than that of incompatible claims (or, for that matter, promises). (This is an instance of a characteristic advantage of   normative   functionalisms over   causal   functionalisms.)  Notice   that   Davidson   started   off   only   with   intentions-in -  action—the case, on the present account, where the performance  is   the acknowledgment of a practical commitment. He later intro -  duces intendings, but he construes them as judgments that some performance is “desirable, good, or what ought to be done.” 10  Since he does not tell us what these normative terms mean, this is objectionably circular. By starting elsewhere, we have seen how to  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n9 6   ◆   Action, Norms, and Practical Reasoning  make independent sense of the expressive role of normative vocabulary. Finally, notice that this account distinguishes:  a .   acting intentionally, which is acknowledging a practical com -  mitment, either in, or by producing, a corresponding perfor -  mance  b.   acting with reasons, which is being entitled to such a com -  mitment  c .   acting for reasons, which is the case where reasons are causes, when acknowledgment of practical commitment is elicited by proper reasoning  VII.   Conclusion  I said at the outset that in this chapter I aimed to do three things:  to explain the expressive role that distinguishes specifically   nor -  mative   vocabulary, that is, to say what it is the job of such vocabulary to make explicit;  to introduce a non-humean way of thinking about   practical rea -  soning;   and to offer a broadly kantian account of the   will   as a rational faculty of practical reasoning  by exploiting the structural analogies between discursive exit tran -  sitions in action and discursive entry transitions in perception to show how the rational will can be understood as no more philo -  sophically mysterious than our capacity to notice red things. Al -  though the account I have offered has of necessity been tele -  graphic,   its   goal   has   been   to   fulfill   that   discursive   practical commitment.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆   ◆   ◆  THRE E  Insights and Blindspot s  of Reliabilis m  I.   The Founding Insight of Reliabilism  One of the most important developments in the theory of knowl -  edge in recent decades has been a shift in emphasis to concern with issues of the   reliability   of various processes of belief forma -  tion. One way of arriving at beliefs is more reliable than another in a specified set of circumstances just insofar as it is more   likely,   in those circumstances, to produce a   true   belief. Classical epistemol -  ogy, taking its cue from Plato, understood knowledge as justified true belief (JTB). While Gettier had raised questions about the joint   sufficiency   of those three conditions, it is only more recently that their individual   necessity   was seriously questioned. What I call the ‘Founding Insight’ of reliabilist epistemologies is the claim that true beliefs can, at least in some cases, amount to genuine knowledge even where the justification condition is not met (in the sense that the candidate knower is unable to produce suitable justifications), provided the beliefs resulted from the exercise of capacities that are   reliable   producers of true beliefs in the circum -  stances in which they were in fact exercised.  The original motivation for the justification leg of the JTB epis -  temological tripod—for, in Plato’s terminology, taking knowl -  edge to require true opinion   plus an account —is that merely  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n9 8   ◆   Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism  accidentally   true beliefs do not generally qualify as cases of knowl -  edge. The man who guesses correctly which road leads to Athens, or who acquires his belief by flipping a coin, should not be said to  know   which is the correct road, even in the cases where he hap -  pens to be right. A space is cleared for reliabilism by the observa -  tion that supplying   evidence   for a claim, offering   reasons   for it,  justifying   it, are not the only ways in which to show that a belief is, if true, not true merely by accident. For that it suffices to show that the belief is of a kind that could, under the prevailing circum -  stances, have been   expected   or   predicted   to be true. 1   That the believer possesses good reasons for the belief is only one basis for such an expectation or prediction.  Consider an expert on classical Central American pottery who over the years has acquired the ability to tell Toltec from Aztec potsherds—reliably though not infallibly—simply by looking at them. We may suppose that there are no separately distinguishing features of the fragments that she can cite in justifying her classifi -  cations. When looking closely at the pieces, she just finds herself believing that some of them are Toltec and others Aztec. Suppose further that she regards beliefs formed in this way with great sus -  picion; she is not willing to put much weight on them, and in par -  ticular   is   not   willing   to   risk   her   professional   reputation   on convictions with this sort of provenance. Before reporting to col -  leagues, or publishing conclusions that rest on evidence as to whether particular bits are Toltec or Aztec, she always does micro -  scopic and chemical analyses that give her solid inferential evi -  dence for the classification. That is, she does not believe that she is a reliable noninferential reporter of Toltec and Aztec potsherds; she insists on confirmatory evidence for beliefs on this topic that she has acquired noninferentially. But suppose that her colleagues, having followed her work over the years, have noticed that she is in fact a reliable distinguisher of one sort of pottery from the other. Her off-the-cuff inclinations to call something Toltec rather than Aztec can be trusted. It seems reasonable for them to  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism   9 9  say, in some case where she turned out to be right, that although she insisted on confirmatory evidence for her belief, in fact she  already knew   that the fragment in question was Toltec, even before bringing her microscope and reagents into play. 2  If that is the right thing to say about a case of this sort, then knowledge attributions can be underwritten by a believer’s   relia -  bility,   even when the believer is not in a position to offer   reasons  for the belief. If they can be so underwritten, then justificatory internalism in epistemology is wrong to restrict attributions of knowledge to cases where the candidate knower can offer reasons inferentially justifying her (true) beliefs. 3   Reliabilism is a kind of epistemological   externalism,   for it maintains that facts of which a believer is not aware, and so cannot cite as reasons—for example, the reliability of her off-the-cuff dispositions to classify pot -  sherds—can   make   the   difference   between   what   she   believes counting as genuine knowledge and its counting merely as true belief.  So accepting the Founding Insight of reliabilism does involve disagreeing with the verdicts of justificatory internalism in some particular cases. But concern with reliability does not simply   con -  tradict   the genuine insights of classical JTB epistemology. Rather, it can be seen as a   generalization   of the classical account. Reason -  ing takes its place as one potentially reliable process among others. Accepting only beliefs one   could   give reasons for—even if one did not acquire the belief inferentially by considering such reasons— is, under many circumstances, a reliable technique of belief forma -  tion. Where it is   not,   where the two criteria collide, it is arguable that the reliability criterion ought to trump the justificatory one. This might happen where inductive reasons could indeed be given for a belief, but where they are such weak reasons that the infer -  ence they underwrite falls short of reliability. Thus a colorful sun -  set may give some reason to believe that the next day will be fine (“Red at night, sailor’s delight . . .”), even though acquiring one’s weather beliefs on that basis may be quite unreliable. In such a  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  10 0   Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism  case, even though one had a reason for what turned out to be a true belief, we might hesitate to say that one   knew   it would not rain. The reliability formula characterizes the role of such sources of knowledge as perception, memory, and testimony—none of which are immediately or obviously inferential in nature—at least as well as, and perhaps better than, a characterization of them in terms of looks, memories, and testimony offering   reasons.   That is because those sources   do   provide reasons sufficient for knowledge  at most   in the cases and the circumstances where they are reliable. Unreliable perception, memory, and testimony are   not   sufficient grounds for knowledge (and not for Gettier reasons).  What conclusions about the relations between reliability and reasons follow from what I have called the Founding Insight of reliabilism? The temptation is to suppose that for the reasons just considered, the concept of reliability of belief-forming processes can simply   replace   the concept of having good reasons for belief— that   all   the explanatory work for which we have been accustomed to call on the latter can be performed as well or better by the for -  mer. Thinking of things this way is thinking of the Founding Insight as motivating a recentering of epistemology. Classical JTB theories of knowledge had taken as central and paradigmatic exemplars true beliefs that the knower could justify inferentially. Beliefs that were the outcome of reliable processes of belief forma -  tion—for instance, the noninferentially arrived-at deliverances of sense perception—qualified as special cases of knowledge just if the believer   knew   (or at least believed) that she was a reliable per -  ceiver under those circumstances, and so could cite her reliability as a   reason   for belief. Reliability appeared as just one sort of reason among others. Reliabilist theories of knowledge take as their cen -  tral and paradigmatic exemplars true beliefs that result from reli -  able belief-forming mechanisms or strategies, regardless of the capacity of the believer to justify the belief, for instance, by citing her reliability. Believing what one can give reasons for appears as just one sort of reliable belief-forming mechanism among others.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism   10 1  More general theoretical considerations also seem to favor the replacement of the concept of reasons with that of reliability in epistemology. For we ought to ask why the concept of knowledge is of philosophical interest at all. It seems clear why we ought to care about the   truth   of beliefs, both our own and those of others. For the success of our actions often turns on the truth of the beliefs on which they are based. 4   But why should we in addition care about whatever feature distinguishes   knowledge   from mere true belief? Surely it is because we want to be able to   rely   on what others say, to provide us information. This interest in interper -  sonal communication of information motivates caring about the reliability of the processes that yield a belief independently of car -  ing about its truth, for we can know something about the one in particular cases without yet knowing about the other. It is not wise to rely on lucky guesses. So independently of the vagaries of the prior epistemological tradition, and independently of how words like ‘know’ happen to be used in natural languages, we have a philosophical interest in investigating the status of beliefs that are produced by reliable processes. The capacity of a believer to provide reasons for her beliefs seems relevant to this story only at one remove: insofar as it contributes to reliability.  There are three distinguishable questions here. First, do the examples pointed to by the Founding Insight as genuine cases of knowledge stand up to critical scrutiny? For instance, ought we to count our pottery expert as having knowledge in advance of hav -  ing reasons and in spite of her disbelief in her own reliability? Sec -  ond, do such examples warrant a recentering of epistemology to focus on reliability of belief-forming processes rather than posses -  sion of reasons as distinctive of the most cognitively significant subclass of true beliefs? Third, does the possibility and advisability of such a recentering of epistemology mean that the explanatory role played by the concepts of reasons, evidence, inference, and justification can be taken over by that of reliable belief-forming processes—that is, that they matter   only   as marks of reliability of  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  10 2   Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism  the beliefs they warrant? The temptation referred to above is the temptation to move from an affirmative answer to the first ques -  tion to an affirmative answer to the other two. This is a temptation that should be resisted. I am prepared to accept the Founding Insight of reliabilism. But I will present reasons to dispute the recentering of epistemology from reasons to reliability to which it tempts us. And I will present further arguments to reject the replacement of the concept of reasons with that of reliability.  II.   Chicken Sexing and Super Blindsight  To begin with, it is important to realize how delicate and special are the cases to which the Founding Insight appeals. If the expert not only   is   reliable but   believes   herself to be reliable, then she   does  have a reason for her belief, and issue is not joined with the justifi -  catory internalist. Although the belief was acquired by noninfer -  ential perceptual mechanisms, it   could   in that case be justified inferentially. For that the shard is (probably) Toltec follows from the claim that the expert is perceptually disposed to call it ‘Toltec’, together with the claim that she is reliable in these matters under these circumstances. After all, to take the expert to be reliable just is to take it that the inference from her being disposed to call something ‘Toltec’ to its being Toltec is a good one. Thus, to get a case of knowledge based on reliability without reasons, we need one where a reliable believer does not take or believe herself to be reliable. These are going to be odd cases, since to qualify as even a candidate knower, the individual in question must nonetheless form a belief.  It is not hard to describe situations in which someone in fact reliably responds differentially to some sort of stimulus without having any idea of the mechanism that is in play. Industrial chicken-sexers can, I am told, reliably sort hatchlings into males and females by inspecting them, without having the least idea how they do it. With enough training, they just catch on. In fact, as I  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism   10 3  hear the story, it has been established that although these experts uniformly believe that they make the discrimination visually, research has shown that the cues their discriminations actually depend on are olfactory. At least in this way of telling the story, they are reliable noninferential reporters of male and female chicks, even though they know nothing about how they can make this discrimination, and so are quite unable to offer   reasons   (con -  cerning how the chick looks or, a fortiori, smells) for believing a particular chick to be male. Again, individuals with blindsight are in the ordinary sense blind, and believe that they cannot respond differentially to visual stimuli. Yet they can, at least in some cir -  cumstances, reasonably reliably discriminate shapes and colors if forced to guess. Ordinary blindsight phenomena do not yield  knowledge,   since the individuals in question do not come to   believe  that, for instance, there is a red square in front of them. The most they will do is to   say   that, as a guess. For an example relevant to reliabilist concerns, we need a sort of super blindsight. Such super blindsight would be a phenomenon, first, in which the subject is more reliable than is typical for ordinary blindsight. For in the ordinary cases, the most one gets is a statistically significant pre -  ponderance of correct guesses relative to chance expectancy. Sec -  ond, it would be a phenomenon in which the blindsighted individual formed an unaccountable   conviction   or belief that, for instance, there was a red square in front of him. Then we might indeed be tempted, as the Founding Insight urges, to say that the blindsighted individual actually   knew   there was a red square in front of him—just as the naive chicken-sexer   knows   that he is inspecting a male chick.  But as we saw already in connection with the archaeological expert, as so far described, these are cases that can cheerfully be accommodated within the framework of justificatory internalism. For though the examples have been carefully constructed so as to involve mechanisms of belief acquisition that are themselves   non -  inferential, this by itself does not entail that the candidate knowers  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  10 4   Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism  cannot offer inferential justifications for those beliefs. An episte -  mological internalism that denied the intelligibility of counting noninferentially acquired beliefs (paradigmatically, those acquired perceptually) as knowledge would be a nonstarter. Perceptual knowledge, according to any JTB account with any initial plausi -  bility at all, depends on the capacity of the perceiver to offer justi -  fying evidence from which the belief   could   have been inferred, even though in fact that is not how it came about. And the idea of reliability of a belief-forming process is exactly what is required to produce a recipe for such ex post facto justifications of noninfer -  entially acquired beliefs. 5   In the standard case, we would expect that a reliable chicken-sexer would come to believe that he is reli -  able. And that belief, together with his inclination to classify a particular chick as male, provides an appropriate inferential   justifi -  cation   for the corresponding noninferentially acquired belief. So to put pressure on classical justificatory internalism, we need to build into the case the constraint that the candidate knower, though in fact reliable, does not believe himself to be reliable. This is perhaps most intuitive in the case of blindsight—even super blindsight—since it is characteristic of the original phenom -  enon that the blindsighted continue to insist that they cannot see anything. They are, after all, blind.  At this point a tension comes to light. If the expert really does  not   take herself to be a reliable noninferential reporter of Toltec potsherds, one might think that it is cognitively irresponsible of her so much as to form the belief that a particular fragment is Toltec in advance of her investigation of microscopic and chemical evidence she   does   take to offer reliable indications. If the chicken -  sexer does not believe that he is a reliable discriminator of male from female chicks (perhaps because he is still early in his training and does not yet realize that he has caught on), what business does he have coming noninferentially to   believe   that a particular chick is male, as opposed merely to finding himself inclined to say so, or putting it in the bin marked “M”? Again,   endorsing   that  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism   10 5  inclination by coming to   believe   the chick is male seems irrespon -  sible at this stage. If the super blindsighted person insists that he is not a reliable reporter of red squares because he is blind and so cannot   see   red squares, how can he at the same time nonetheless genuinely   believe   that there is a red square in front of him? When thus fully described, are the cases that motivate the Founding Insight still coherent and intelligible?  I think that they are. There   is   a certain sort of cognitive irre -  sponsibility involved in those who do not take themselves to be reliable reporters of a certain sort of phenomenon nonetheless coming to believe the reports they find themselves inclined to make. But I do not think that is a decisive reason to deny that it is intelligible to acquire beliefs in this way. Cognitively irresponsible beliefs can genuinely be beliefs. And in these very special cases, such irresponsible beliefs can qualify as knowledge. At the very least, I do not think it is open to the convinced justificatory inter -  nalist epistemologist to insist on the incoherence of examples meeting the stringent conditions that have just been rehearsed. For to be ‘cognitively responsible’ in the sense invoked in point -  ing to the tensions above just means not forming beliefs for which one cannot offer any kind of a reason. Treating examples of the sort sketched above as incoherent is in effect building this require -  ment into the definition of ‘belief ’—so that what one has ac -  quired cannot count as a belief unless one is in a position to offer at least some kind of reason for it. To impose that sort of re -  quirement is surely to beg the question against the reliabilist epis -  temologist.  In fact, there is nothing unintelligible about having beliefs for which we cannot give reasons. Faith—understood broadly as un -  dertaking commitments without claiming corresponding entitle -  ments—is surely not an incoherent concept. (Nor is it by any means the exclusive province of religion.) And should the convic -  tions of the faithful turn out not only to be true but also (unbe -  knownst to them) to result from reliable belief-forming processes,  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  10 6   Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism  I do not see why they should not be taken to constitute knowl -  edge. The proper lesson to draw from the tension involved in the sorts of examples of knowledge to which the Founding Insight draws our attention, I think, is not that those examples are inco -  herent but that they are in principle exceptional. Knowledge based on reliability without the subject’s having reasons for it 6   is possible as a local phenomenon, but not as a global one.  III.   Epistemology and Semantics  What would it be like for   all   our knowledge, indeed, all our   belief,  to be like the examples we have been considering? Granted that cognitively irresponsible belief is possible in special, isolated cases, can we coherently describe practices in which people genuinely have beliefs, but   all   of them are cognitively irresponsible in that they are knowingly held in the absence of reasons for them? Put differently, do belief-forming practices of the sort that motivate the Founding Insight form an autonomous set—that is, a set of practices of belief formation that one could have though one had no others?  This is an important question in the context of the temptation to understand the significance of the Founding Insight of reliabil -  ism as warranting a   recentering   of epistemology to focus on the reliability of belief-forming processes rather than on possession of reasons as what distinguishes the most philosophically interesting subclass of true beliefs. For the reason-giving practices that the classical justificatory internalist takes as paradigmatic ingredients of knowledge   are   autonomous in this sense. That is, we   can   make sense of a community whose members formed beliefs only when they thought they had justifications for them. Clearly all of their inferentially arrived-at beliefs can meet this condition. For the noninferentially acquired beliefs, we must insist only that they form   beliefs   noninferentially only in cases where they believe themselves to be reliable.   Those   beliefs can in turn have been  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism   10 7  acquired from others (who are and are taken already to be reli -  able), who train the novices in their discriminations. Thus chil -  dren learn reliably to sort lollipops into piles labeled with color words first, and only once certified as reliable noninferential dis -  criminators of colors do they graduate to forming   beliefs   of the form “That lollipop is purple.” At that stage, if asked what reasons they have for those beliefs, they can invoke their own reliability. This invocation may be implicit, consisting, for instance, in saying something like, “I can tell what things are purple by looking at them.” They might even say, “It looks purple to me,” where this need be no more than a code for “I find myself inclined to sort it into the pile labeled ‘purple’.” 7  It is at the very least unclear that we can make sense of a com -  munity of believers who, while often holding true beliefs, and generally acquiring them by reliable mechanisms,   never   are in a position to offer reasons for their beliefs. This would require that they never take themselves or one another to be reliable. For any attribution of reliability (when conjoined with a claim about what the reliable one believes or is inclined to say)   inferentially   under -  writes a conclusion. A community precluded from giving reasons for beliefs cannot so much as have the concept of reliability—nor, accordingly (by anyone’s lights), of knowledge. Its members can serve as measuring instruments—that is, reliable indicators—both of perceptible environing states and of one another’s responses. But they cannot treat themselves or one another as doing that. For they do not discriminate between reliable indication and unreliable indication. Absent such discrimination, they cannot be taken to understand themselves or one another as   indicators   at all. For the very notion of a   correlation   between the states of an instrument and the states that it is a candidate for measuring is unintelligible apart from the assessments of reliability. Although they are reliable indicators, they do not in fact rely on their own or one another’s indications, since they draw no conclusions from them.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  10 8   Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism  I think these are good reasons to deny that what such reliable indicators have is knowledge. But the reasons forwarded thus far are at best probative, not dispositive. So far, however, our atten -  tion has been focused on the third condition on the concept of knowledge: whatever distinguishes it from mere true belief. If we shift our attention to the first condition—the condition that one does not know what one does not   believe —stronger reasons to doubt the intelligibility of the reliability-without-reasons scenario emerge. For states that do not stand in inferential relations to one another, that do not serve as reasons one for another, are not rec -  ognizable as beliefs at all. The world is full of reliable indicators. Chunks of iron rust in wet environments and not in dry ones. Land mines explode when impressed by anything weighing more than a certain amount. Bulls charge red flapping bits of material. And so on. Their reliable dispositions to respond differentially to stimuli, and thereby to sort the stimuli into kinds, do not qualify as   cognitive,   because the responses that are reliably differentially elicited are not applications of   concepts.   They are not the forma -  tion of   beliefs.   Why not? What else is required for the reliable responses to count as beliefs? What difference makes the differ -  ence between a parrot trained to utter “That’s red” in the pres -  ence of red things and a genuine noninferential reporter of red things who responds to their visible presence by acquiring the per -  ceptual   belief that   there is something red in front of her?  At a minimum, I want to say, it is the   inferential articulation   of the response. Beliefs—indeed, anything that is propositionally contentful (whose content is in principle specifiable by using a declarative sentence or a ‘that’ clause formed from one), and so conceptually articulated—are essentially things that can serve as premises and conclusions of inferences. The subject of genuine perceptual beliefs is, as the parrot is not, responding to the visible presence of red things by making a potential move in a game of giving and asking for reasons: applying a concept. The believer is adopting a stance that involves further consequential commit-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism   10 9  ments (for instance, to the object perceived as being colored) that is incompatible with other commitments (for instance, to the object perceived being green), and that one can show one’s enti -  tlements to in terms of other commitments (for instance, to the object perceived being scarlet). No response that is not a node in a network of such broadly inferential involvements, I claim, is rec -  ognizable as the application of   concepts.   And if not, it is not recog -  nizable as a belief, or the expression of a belief, either.  We ought to respect the distinction between genuine percep -  tual   beliefs —which require the application of   concepts —and the reliable responses of minerals, mines, and matador fodder. I claim that an essential element of that distinction is the potential role as both premise and conclusion in reasoning (both theoretical and practical) that beliefs play. One might choose to draw this line dif -  ferently, though I am not aware of a plausible competitor. But I do not think it is open to the reliabilist epistemologist to refuse to draw a line at all. To do that—not merely to broaden somewhat the third condition on knowledge, but to reject the first out of hand—is to change the subject radically. It is not to disagree about the analysis of knowledge but to insist on talking about something else entirely. 8  If there is anything to this line of thought, then it is simply a mistake to think that the notion of being reliable could take over the explanatory role played by the notion of having reasons. For what distinguishes propositionally contentful and therefore con -  ceptually articulated   beliefs,   including those that qualify as knowl -  edge, from the merely reliable responses or representations of noncognitive creatures—those that have know- how   but are not in the knowing- that   line of work—is (at least) that they can both serve as and stand in need of   reasons.   I call the failure to realize this limitation on the explanatory powers of the concept of reliability the ‘Conceptual Blindspot’ of reliabilism.  That it is a mistake is at base a   semantic   point. But because of the   belief   condition on knowledge, it serves also to temper the  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  11 0   Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism  conclusions we are entitled to draw from the Founding Insight of  epistemological   reliabilism concerning the   justification   condition. The examples of knowledge based on reliability without the possi -  bility of offering reasons, which motivate the Founding Insight, are   essentially   fringe phenomena. Their intelligibility is parasitic on that   of   the   reason-giving   practices   that   underwrite   ordinary ascriptions of knowledge—and indeed of belief   tout court.   Prac -  tices in which some beliefs are accorded the status of true and jus -  tified   are   autonomous—intelligible   as   games   one   could   play though one played no other. Practices in which the only status beliefs can have besides being true is having been reliably pro -  duced are not autonomous in that sense. We must carefully resist the temptation to overstate the significance of the Founding Insight of reliabilism. Besides serving as a kind of reason, reliabil -  ity can take a subordinate place alongside reasons in certifying beliefs as knowledge. But it cannot displace giving and asking for reasons from its central place in the understanding of cognitive practice.  IV.   Reliabilism and Naturalism  So the proper domain of reliabilism is epistemology rather than semantics. Within epistemology, its proper lessons pertain to the condition that distinguishes knowledge from mere true belief. It does not provide the resources to distinguish the genus of which knowledge is a species— conceptually   articulated, in particular  propositionally   contentful attitudes of   belief —from the sorts of reliable indication exhibited by reliably indicating artifacts such as measuring instruments. Now, perhaps in pointing out that it would be a mistake to treat appeals to reliability as a candidate for replacing appeals to reasons in these broader explanatory domains I am attacking a straw man. The temptations to generalize the lessons of the Founding Insight to which I have been urging resis -  tance may not be widely felt. Insofar as they are not, it would be  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism   11 1  tendentious to describe the merely notional possibility of such misguided overgeneralizations as constituting a flaw or blindspot in reliabilism itself—once the boundaries of that doctrine are suit -  ably circumscribed.  However it may be with this temptation, there is another that is surely part and parcel of reliabilism’s contemporary appeal in epis -  temology. That is the idea that reliabilism provides at least the raw materials for a   naturalized   epistemology—one that will let us exhibit states of knowledge as products of natural processes fully intelligible in broadly physicalistic terms. The strictures just re -  hearsed counsel us to take care in stating this ambition. Epistemo -  logical reliabilism suggests a path whereby   if   and   insofar as   the concept of (propositionally contentful)   belief   can be naturalized, so can the concept of   knowledge.   Reliabilism promises a recipe for extending the one sort of account to the other. The qualification codified in the antecedent of this conditional is not trivial, but nei -  ther is the conditional. In particular, it expresses a claim that con -  vinced justificatory internalists might well have felt obliged to doubt. For if and insofar as what distinguishes knowledge from other true beliefs must be understood in terms of possession of  good reasons   or of justificatory   entitlement   or   warrant,   pessimism about the prospects for eventual naturalistic domestication of these latter normative notions would extend to the concept of knowledge itself.  A belief-forming mechanism is   reliable   (in specified circum -  stances), just in case it is objectively   likely   (in those circumstances) to result in   true   beliefs. If the notions of   belief   and   truth   have been explained physicalistically or naturalistically 9 —a substantive task, to be sure, but perhaps not a distinctively   epistemological   one— then one of the promises of reliabilism in epistemology is that all one needs to extend those accounts to encompass also   knowledge  is a naturalistic story about objective likelihood. But since it is  objective   likelihood that is at issue—and not subjective matters of conviction or evidence, of what else the subject knows or  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  11 2   Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism  believes—such a story should not, it seems, be far to seek. For objective probabilities are a staple of explanations in the natural sciences, indeed, even in fundamental physics. The second conclu -  sion the Founding Insight of reliabilism tempts us to draw is ac -  cordingly that it provides a recipe for a purely naturalistic account at least of what distinguishes knowledge from other true beliefs.  This line of thought is widely endorsed, even by those who do not applaud the project that motivates it. For it seems to me that even those who reject the premises that form its antecedent accept the conditional that   if   the concept of reliability can do the work previously done by notions of evidence or good reasons in distin -  guishing knowledge from merely true belief, and   if   naturalistic accounts of the concepts of   belief   and of   truth   are forthcoming,  then   a naturalistic account of knowledge is possible. That at least this   inference   is good is almost universally taken not only to be true but also to be   obviously   true. I think, however, that it is   not   a good inference. When we understand properly the sense in which facts about the reliability of a mechanism can be objective, we see that appeals to objective probability fall short of enabling fully naturalistic accounts of knowledge—even given the optimistic assumptions built into the premises of the inference. Seeing why this is so (in the next section of the chapter) provides the clues needed to formulate (in the final section) the lesson that we really ought to learn from the Founding Insight: what I will call the Implicit Insight of reliabilism.  V.   Barn Facades and Goldman’s Insight  The difficulty is a straightforward and familiar one, although I believe that its significance has not fully been appreciated. An objective probability can be specified only relative to a reference class. And in the full range of cognitive situations epistemological theories are obliged to address—by contrast to the carefully ideal -  ized situations described in artificially restricted vocabularies to  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism   11 3  which concepts of objective probability are applied in the special sciences—the world as it objectively is, apart from our subjective interests and concerns (paradigmatically, explanatory ones), does not in general privilege one of the competing universe of possible reference classes as the correct or appropriate one. Relative to a choice of reference class, we can make sense of the idea of objec -  tive probabilities, and so of objective facts about the reliability of various cognitive mechanisms or processes—facts specifiable in a naturalistic vocabulary. But the proper choice of reference class is not itself objectively determined by facts specifiable in a naturalis -  tic vocabulary. So there is something left over.  The best way I know to make this point is by considering Alvin Goldman’s barn facade example. This is perhaps ironic, because Goldman originally introduced the case in   197 6   in a classic paper that demolished the pretensions of then-dominant   causal   theories of knowledge, precisely in order to make room for the sort of reli -  abilist alternatives that have held sway ever since. 10   While I do think this kind of example is decisive against causal theories of knowl -  edge, in the context of aspirations to naturalize epistemology by appeal to considerations of reliability, it is a double-edged sword.  We are to imagine a physiologically normal perceiver, in stan -  dard conditions for visual perception (facing the object, in good light, no lenses or mirrors intervening, and so on), who is looking at a red barn. It looks like a red barn, he has seen many red barns before, and he is moved to say, and to believe, that there is a red barn in front of him. In fact, there is a red barn in front of him causing him perceptually to say and believe that. So his claim and his belief are true. He has the best reasons a perceiver could have for his belief: all the evidence he possesses confirms that it is a red barn and that he can see that it is. Of central importance to Gold -  man’s original purpose is that we may suppose that the causal chain linking the perceiver to the red barn in front of him is ideal; it is just as such causal chains should be in cases of genuine percep -  tual knowledge. (We may not know how to formulate conditions  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  11 4   Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism  on such chains necessary or sufficient to qualify them as knowl -  edge, but whatever they may be, we are stipulating that those con -  ditions are met in this case.) The perceiver has a true belief, has good reasons for that belief, and stands in the right causal rela -  tions to the object of his belief. Surely, one wants to say at this point, what he has in such a case is perceptual knowledge if any -  thing is.  But things are less clear as we describe the case further, moving to facts   external   to the perceiver’s beliefs, to his perceptual pro -  cessing and to causal relations between the perceiver and what is perceived. For although the red barn our hero thinks he sees is indeed a red barn, it is, unbeknownst to him, located in Barn Facade County. There the local hobby is building incredibly real -  istic trompe l’oeil barn facades. In fact, our man is looking at the  only   real barn in the county—though there are   99 9   facades. These facades are so cunningly contrived that they are visually indistin -  guishable from actual barns. Were our subject (counterfactually) to be looking at one of the facades, he would form exactly the same beliefs he actually did about the real barn. That is, he would, falsely now, believe himself to be looking at an actual barn. It is just an accident that he happened on the one real barn.  The question is, does he know there is a red barn in front of him? A good case can be made that he does not. For though he has a true belief, it is only   accidentally   true. It is true only because he happened to stumble on the one real barn out of a thousand apparent ones. This seems to be a case of exactly the sort that the third condition on knowledge, the one distinguishing it from merely accidentally true beliefs, was introduced to exclude. If that is right—and I think it is—then it shows that classical justificatory epistemological internalism is inadequate. 11   It also shows that appeal to the causal chain linking the believer to what his belief is about is not adequate to distinguish knowledge from merely acci -  dentally true belief—the surprising conclusion Goldman was orig -  inally after. For not only does the presence of barn facades in the  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism   11 5  vicinity—indeed, their local preponderance—not affect the beliefs the candidate knower can appeal to as evidence for or reasons jus -  tifying his belief, but it is also   causally   irrelevant to the process by which that belief was formed.  Goldman’s positive conclusion, of course, is that the difference that makes the epistemological difference in such cases is that in the circumstances in which the belief was actually formed—that is, in Barn Facade County—the subject is not a   reliable   perceiver of barns. Forming a belief as to whether something is a barn by look -  ing at it is not, in that vicinity, a reliable belief-forming mecha -  nism. What is special about this case is just that the circumstances that render unreliable here what elsewhere would be a reliable process are   external   to the subject’s beliefs and to their connec -  tion to their causal antecedents. Goldman took a giant step here. Both the critical argument and the positive suggestion he drew from it—the combination I call ‘Goldman’s Insight’—are epoch -  making philosophical moves. But what is the exact significance of Goldman’s reliabilist insight? Once we have rejected narrowly causal theories of the third condition on knowledge, and also clas -  sical justificatory internalist theories, what consequences should we draw from the demonstration of the positive bearing of exter -  nal matters of reliability on assessments of knowledge? In particu -  lar, does Goldman’s Insight support   naturalistic   ambitions in epistemology?  I think not. One of the happy features of Goldman’s example is that it literalizes the metaphor of   boundaries   of reference classes. For suppose that Barn Facade County is one of a hundred coun -  ties in the state, all the rest of which eschew facades in favor of actual barns. Then, considered as an exercise of a differential re -  sponsive disposition within the   state   rather than within the county, our subject’s process of perceptual belief formation may be quite reliable, and hence when it in fact yields correct beliefs, it may underwrite attributions of perceptual   knowledge.   But then, if the whole country, consisting of fifty larger states, shares the habits of  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  11 6   Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism  Barn Facade County—so that over the whole country (excepting this one state) facades predominate by a large margin—then con -  sidered as a capacity exercised in the   country,   the very same capac -  ity will count as quite   un reliable, and hence as insufficient to underwrite attributions of knowledge. And then again, in the whole   world,   barns may outnumber facades by a large margin. So considered with respect to that reference class, the capacity would once again count as reliable. And so on. Do we need to know about the relative frequencies of barns and facades in the solar sys -  tem or the galaxy in order to answer questions about the cognitive status of our subject’s beliefs? And yet, if instead of looking at ever broader reference classes we turn our attention to ever narrower ones, we end up with a reference class consisting simply of the actual exercise of the capacity in looking at a real barn. Within  that   reference class, the probability of arriving at a true belief is   1 , since the unique belief arrived at in that situation is actually true. So with respect to the narrowest possible reference class, the belief-forming mechanism is maximally reliable.  Which is the correct reference class? Is the perceiver an objec -  tively reliable identifier of barns or not? I submit that the facts as described do not determine an answer. Relative to each reference class there is a clear answer, but nothing in the way the world is privileges one of those reference classes, and hence picks out one of those answers. An argument place remains to be filled in, and the way the world objectively is does not, by itself, fill it in. Put another way, the reliability of the belief-forming mechanism (and hence the status of its true products as states of knowledge) varies depending on how we describe the mechanism and the believer. Described as apparently perceiving this barn, he is reliable and knows there is a barn in front of him. Described as an apparent barn-perceiver in this county, he is not reliable and does not know there is a barn in front of him. Described as an apparent barn -  perceiver in the state, he is again reliable and a knower, while described as an apparent barn-perceiver in the country as a whole  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism   11 7  he is not. And so on. All these descriptions are equally true of him. All are ways of specifying his location that can equally be expressed in purely naturalistic vocabulary. But these naturalistically statable facts yield different verdicts about the perceiver’s reliability, and hence about his status as a knower. And no naturalistically statable facts pick out one or another of these descriptions as uniquely privileged or correct. So the naturalistically statable facts do not, according to epistemological reliabilism, settle whether or not the perceiver is a knower in the case described.  Now, the case described is exceptional in many ways. Not every cognitive situation admits of descriptions in terms of nested, equally natural reference classes that generate alternating verdicts of reliability and unreliability. But I am not claiming that the idea of reliability is of no cognitive or epistemological significance. I am not denying Goldman’s Insight. But situations with the struc -  ture of the barn facade example can arise, and they are counterex -  amples to the claim that reliabilism underwrites a naturalized epistemology—the mistaken idea that may be called the ‘Natural -  istic Blindspot’ of reliabilism.  VI.   Inference and the Implicit Insight of Reliabilism  How, then,   ought   we to understand the significance of consid -  erations of reliability in epistemology? How can we properly acknowledge both the Founding Insight and Goldman’s Insight while avoiding both the Conceptual and the Naturalistic Blind -  spot? And if not naturalism, what?   Super naturalism? I think the key to answering these important questions is to see that, far from being opposed to considerations of what is a good reason for what, concern with reliability should itself be understood as con -  cern with the goodness of a distinctive kind of   inference.   I will call this idea the ‘Implicit Insight’ of epistemological reliabilism.  Epistemology is usually thought of as the theory of knowledge. But epistemological theories in fact typically offer accounts of  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  11 8   Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism  when it is proper to   attribute   knowledge: for instance, where there is justified true belief, or where true beliefs have resulted from reliable belief-forming processes. Now, a theory of knowl -  edge can take this form. The two might be related as formal to material mode, in Carnap’s terminology; instead of asking what  X   ’s are, we ask when the term ‘X’ is properly applied. But the two need not be versions of the same question. In the case of knowl -  edge, I think they stand in a more complex relationship.  What is one doing in taking someone to have knowledge? The traditional tripartite response surely has the right form. To begin with, one is attributing some sort of   commitment:   a belief. For the reasons indicated above in connection with the Conceptual Blindspot, I think that being so committed must be understood as taking up a stance in an   inferentially   articulated network—that is, one in which one commitment carries with it various others as its inferential consequences and rules out others that are incompat -  ible. Only as occupying a position in such a network can it be understood as   propositionally   (and hence   conceptually ) contentful. Corresponding to the traditional justification condition on attri -  butions of knowledge, we may say that not just any commitment will do. For it to be   knowledge   one is attributing, one must also take the commitment to be one the believer is in some sense   enti -  tled   to. Mindful of the Founding Insight, we need not assume that the only way a believer can come to be entitled to a proposi -  tionally contentful commitment is by being able to offer an infer -  ential justification of it. Instead, entitlement may be attributed on the basis of an assessment of the reliability of the process that resulted in the commitment’s being undertaken. We will return to look more closely at attributions of reliability, our final topic, just below.  So to take someone to know something, one must do two things: attribute a certain kind of inferentially articulated   commit -  ment,   and attribute a certain kind of   entitlement   to that commit -  ment. 12   But not all beliefs to which the believer is entitled count as  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism   11 9  knowledge. One takes them so to qualify only where one takes them in addition to be   true.   What is it to do that? Taking a claim or belief to be true is not attributing an especially interesting and mysterious property to it; it is doing something else entirely. It is   endorsing   the claim oneself. Spurious metaphysical problems concerning the property of truth are what one gets if one   mis -  understands what one is doing in   adopting   a stance oneself—under -  taking a commitment—on the model of   describing, characterizing,  or   attributing   a property to someone   else ’s commitment. A corre -  sponding mistake would be to think of making a promise, for instance, that one would drive one’s friend to the airport, as attributing a special sort of property to the proposition that one will drive one’s friend to the airport—a property whose rela -  tion to one’s own motivational structure will then cry out for explanation.  In calling what someone has ‘knowledge’, one is doing three things:   attributing   a   commitment   that is capable of serving both as premise and as conclusion of inferences relating it to other commitments,   attributing entitlement   to that commitment, and  undertaking   that   same   commitment   oneself. 13   Doing   this   is adopting a complex, essentially   socially   articulated stance or posi -  tion in the game of giving and asking for reasons. I will not attempt to develop or defend this way of understanding knowl -  edge as a normative social status here; I have done so at length in  Making It Explicit. 14   I have sketched it here because of the per -  spective it gives us on the role of attributions of   reliability   in securing entitlement to beliefs.  For suppose that, in the same spirit in which we just asked what one is   doing   in taking someone to be a knower, we ask what one is  doing   in taking someone to be a   reliable   former of noninferential beliefs about, say, red barns in front of him. To take someone to be a reliable reporter of red barns, under certain circumstances, is to take it that his reports of barns, in those circumstances, are likely to be   true.   According to the account just offered, to do that  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  12 0   Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism  is to be inclined to   endorse   those reports oneself. And that means that what one is doing in taking someone to be reliable is endors -  ing a distinctive kind of   inference:   an inference, namely, from the  attribution   to another of a propositionally contentful commit -  ment acquired under certain circumstances to the   endorsement   or  undertaking   oneself of a commitment with that same content. Inferences exhibiting this socially articulated structure are   relia -  bility inferences.   Endorsing such an inference is just what being prepared to   rely   on someone else as an informant consists in: being willing to use   his   commitments as premises in one’s   own   inferences (including practical ones).  The possibility of extracting information from the remarks of others is one of the main points of the practice of assertion, and of attributing beliefs to others. So reliability inferences play an absolutely central role in the game of giving and asking for rea -  sons—indeed, every bit as central as the closely related but distin -  guishable assessments of the   truth   of others’ claims and beliefs. That concern with reliability is not opposed to concern with what is a reason for what, but actually a crucially important species of it, is what I want to call the Implicit Insight of reliabilism. Reliabil -  ism deserves to be called a form of epistemological   externalism,  because assessments of reliability (and hence of knowledge) can turn on considerations external to the reasons possessed by the candidate knower himself. In those cases, such assessments con -  cern the reasons possessed by the   assessor   of knowledge rather than by the   subject   of knowledge. The lesson I want to draw is that they should not therefore be seen as external to the game of giving and asking for reasons, nor to concern with what is a reason for what. Reliabilism points to the fundamental   social   or   interpersonal   artic -  ulation of the practices of reason giving and reason assessing within which questions of who has knowledge arise.  A final dividend that this way of thinking about reliability pays is that it permits us to see what is really going on in the barn facade cases, and so how to take on board Goldman’s Insight. For the  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism   12 1  relativity to reference class of assessments of reliability (and hence of knowledge) that seemed so puzzling when viewed in a context that excluded concern with what is a reason for what falls naturally into place once we understand assessments of reliability as issues of what   inferences   to endorse. The different reference classes just correspond to different (true) collateral premises or auxiliary hypotheses that can be conjoined with the attribution of noninfer -  entially acquired perceptual belief in order to extract inferential consequences the assessor of reliability (and knowledge) can use as premises in her   own   inferences. From the perceiver’s report of a red barn and the premise that he is located in Barn Facade County, there is   not   a good inference to the conclusion that there is a red barn in front of him. From the perceiver’s report and the premise that he is located in the   state,   there   is   a good inference to that conclusion. From the report and the premise that he is located in the   country,   there is not a good inference to that con -  clusion. And so on. All those collateral premises are true, so there are a number of candidate reliability inferences to be assessed. But there is no contradiction, because they are all   different   inferences. Nothing spooky or supernatural is going on—of course. The rela -  tivity to description that is threatening to an understanding of reli -  ability and knowledge that ignores reason giving, justification, and inference can be taken in stride once we see concern with reli -  ability as arising in just such contexts. For we expect the goodness of inferences to be sensitive to differences in how the items we are reasoning about are described. The intensionality of assessments of reliability is just a mark of their membership in the inferential order rather than the causal order. And we saw in the previous chapter, we should expect material inferences of this sort to be nonmonotonic.  To avoid the Conceptual Blindspot, one must appreciate the significance of specifically   inferential   articulation in distinguish -  ing representations that qualify as   beliefs,   and hence as candidates for knowledge. To avoid the Naturalistic Blindspot, one must  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  12 2   Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism  appreciate that concern with reliability is concern with a distinc -  tive interpersonal   inferential   structure. Appreciating the role of inference in these explanatory contexts is grasping the Implicit Insight of reliabilism. It is what is required to conserve and extend both the Founding Insight and Goldman’s Insight without being crippled by the difficulties into which they tempt us.

Singular Terms and Objects  What conditions on the use of an expression are necessary and suf -  ficient for it to be functioning as or playing the role of a singular term? What sort of expressive impoverishment is a language con -  demned to by not having anything playing that sort of role? The answers to these questions may seem straightforward, at least in the large. Singular terms are linguistic expressions that refer to, denote, or designate particular objects. 1   The point of having something playing this role in linguistic practice is to make it pos -  sible to talk about particular objects, which, together with their properties and relations, make up the world in which the practice is conducted.  The first of these claims may be accepted without accepting the order of explanation presupposed by the transition from the first claim to the second. To begin with, it may be questioned whether the concept   particular object   can be made intelligible without appeal to the concept   singular term.   Frege, for instance, implicitly denies this when in the   Grundlagen   he explains the ontological category of particular objects, to which he is concerned to argue  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  12 4   What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?  numbers belong, in effect as comprising whatever can be referred to by using singular terms, to which linguistic category he argues numerals belong.  Put somewhat more carefully, the first answer forwarded above must be: singular terms are expressions that, in Quine’s useful phrase “ purport   to refer to just one object.” Quine is suspicious of the full-blooded notions of representational purport implicit in intentional idioms, and the echoes in his phrase are a reminder of his desire to explain much of what they might be thought to explain by appeal to more austere linguistic analogs. For singular referential purport, in the sense he appeals to, need not be an intentional affair. As Quine is quick to point out, “Such talk of purport is only a picturesque way of alluding to the distinctive grammatical role that singular . . . terms play in sentences.” 2   The real task is to specify this role. Explanatory ground is gained by appeal to the principle Quine states only in the presence of such an account. That story, however, would offer a direct answer to the question “What is a singular term?”—one that does not appeal to (but on the contrary can itself be used via Quine’s principle to help explain) the dark and pregnant notion of referential or repre -  sentational purport. It is such an account that I aim to provide in the remainder of this chapter.  2 .   Subsentential Expressions and Projecting the Use of Novel Sentences  The pre-Kantian tradition took it for granted that the proper order of semantic explanation begins with a doctrine of concepts or terms, divided into singular and general, whose meaningfulness can be grasped independently of and prior to the meaningfulness of judgments. Appealing to this basic level of interpretation, a doctrine of judgments then explains the combination of concepts into judgments, and how the correctness of the resulting judg -  ments depends on what is combined and how. Appealing to this  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?   12 5  derived interpretation of judgments, a doctrine of consequences finally explains the combination of judgments into inferences, and how the correctness of inferences depends on what is combined and how. Kant rejects this. One of his cardinal innovations is the claim that the fundamental unit of awareness or cognition, the minimum graspable, is the judgment. For him, interpretations of something as classified or classifier (term or predicate) make sense only as remarks about its role in judgment. In the   Grundlagen,  Frege follows this Kantian line in insisting that “only in the con -  text of a proposition [ Satz ] does a name have any meaning.” 3  Frege takes this position because it is only to the utterance of sen -  tences that pragmatic force attaches, and the explanatory purpose of associating semantic content with expressions is to provide a systematic account of such force.  Since semantics must in this way answer to pragmatics, the cate -  gory of sentences has a certain kind of explanatory priority over subsentential categories of expression, such as singular terms and predicates. For sentences are the kind of expression whose free -  standing utterance (that is, whose utterance unembedded in the utterance of some larger expression containing it) has the prag -  matic significance of performing a speech act. Declarative sen -  tences are those whose utterance typically has the significance of an assertion, of making a claim. Accordingly, there is available a sort of answer to the questions “What are sentences, and why are there any?” that is not available for any subsentential expression: Sentences are expressions whose unembedded utterance performs a speech act such as making a claim, asking a question, or giving a command. Without expressions of this category, there can be no speech acts of any kind, and hence no specifically linguistic practice.  From this point of view it is not obvious why there should be subsentential expressions at all, for they cannot have the same sort of fundamental pragmatic role to play that sentences do. So we ought to start by asking a question more general than that of the  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  12 6   What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?  subtitle of this chapter: “What are subsentential expressions, and why are there any?” Given the pragmatic priority of sentences, why should other semantically significant categories be discerned at all? Sentences are assigned semantic contents as part of an ex -  planation of what one is doing in asserting them, what one claims, what belief one avows thereby. But the utterance of an essentially subsentential expression, such as a singular term, is not the perfor -  mance of this sort of speech act. It does not by itself make a move in the language game, does not alter the score of commitments and attitudes that it is appropriate for an audience to attribute to the speaker. Accordingly, such expressions cannot have semantic contents in the same sense in which sentences can. They cannot serve as premises and conclusions of   inferences.   They can be taken to be semantically contentful only in a derivative sense, insofar as their occurrence as components in sentences contributes to the contents (in the basic, practice-relevant inferential sense) of those sentences.  If, because of their pragmatic priority, one begins rather with the semantic interpretation of sentences, what is the motivation for decomposing them so as to interpret subsentential expressions as well? Why recognize the semantically significant occurrence of expressions of any category other than sentences? Frege begins one of his later essays with this response: “It is astonishing what language can do. With a few syllables it can express an incalculable number of thoughts, so that even a thought grasped by a human being for the very first time can be put into a form of words which will be understood by someone to whom the thought is entirely new. This would be impossible, were we not able to distinguish parts in the thought corresponding to parts of a sentence.” 4  The ability to produce and understand an indefinite number of novel sentences is a striking and essential feature of linguistic prac -  tice. As Chomsky has since emphasized, such creativity is the rule rather than the exception. Almost every sentence uttered by an adult native speaker is being uttered for the first time—not just  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?   12 7  the first time for that speaker, but the first time in human history. This high proportion of sentential novelty appears in surveys of empirically recorded discourses, and becomes evident on statisti -  cal grounds when one compares the number of sentences of, say, thirty or fewer words with the number there has been time for English speakers to have uttered, even if we never did anything else. 5   “Please pass the salt” may get a lot of play, but it is excep -  tionally unlikely that a sentence chosen at random from this book, for instance, would ever have been inscribed or otherwise uttered by someone else.  The point is often made that individual speakers in training are exposed to correct uses only of a relatively small finite number of sentences, and must on that basis somehow acquire practical mas -  tery, responsive and productive, of proprieties of practice govern -  ing an indefinitely larger number. 6   The need to explain the possibility of projecting proper uses for many sentences from those for a few is not just a constraint on accounts of language learning by individuals, however. For what is of interest is not just how the trick (of acquiring practical linguistic competence) might be done, but equally what the trick consists in, what counts as doing it. As I just remarked, the whole linguistic community, by the most diachronically inclusive standards of community mem -  bership, has only produced (as correct) or responded to (as cor -  rect) a set of sentences that is small relative to the set of sentences one who attributes to them a language is thereby obliged to take it they have somehow determined correct uses for. The idea that there is a difference between correct and incorrect uses of sen -  tences no one has yet used involves some sort of projection.  We are well advised to follow Frege in taking seriously the fact that the sentences we are familiar with do, after all, have parts. A two-stage compositional strategy for the explanation of projection would take it that what is settled by proprieties of use governing the smaller, sample set of sentences, which is projected, is the cor -  rect use of the subsentential components into which they can be  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  12 8   What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?  analyzed or decomposed. The correct use of these components is then to be understood as determining the correct use also of fur -  ther combinations of them into novel sentences. 7   The linguistic community determines the correct use of some sentences, and thereby of the words they involve, and so determines the correct use of the rest of the sentences that can be expressed by using those words. (Notice that I am talking about projecting   proprieties  governing some sentences from   proprieties   governing others,   not  about projecting any of those proprieties from nonnormatively characterized   dispositions. )  The need to project a distinction between proper and improper use for novel sentences provides the broad outlines of an answer to the question “What are subsentential expressions for?” or “Why are there any subsentential expressions?” But what   are   sub -  sentential expressions, functionally? According to the two-stage explanatory scheme, there are two sorts of constraints on the cor -  rect use of subsentential expressions, corresponding to their de -  compositional and compositional roles, respectively. Their correct use must be determined by the correct use of the relatively small subset of the sentences in which they can appear as components, and their correct use must collectively determine the correct use of all the sentences in which they can appear as components.  The key to the solution Frege endorses is the notion of   substi -  tution.   For the first, or decompositional stage, sentences are to be analyzed into subsentential components by being assimilated as substitutional variants of one another—that is, related by be -  ing substitutionally accessible one from another. Regarding two sentences as substitutional variants of each other is discerning in them applications of the same function, in Frege’s sense. In the second, or recompositional stage, novel sentences (and their interpretations) are to be generated as applications of familiar functions to familiar substitutable expressions. Familiar sorts of substitutional variation of familiar classes of sentences result in a host of unfamiliar sentences. It is this substitutional clue to the  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?   12 9  nature of subsentential expressions and their interpretation that is pursued in what follows.  II.   What Are Singular Terms?  1 .   Syntax: Substitution-Structural Roles  First let me talk about   syntax.   “What are singular terms?” The question has been posed from the point of view of someone who understands (or is prepared to pretend to understand) already what it is to use an expression as a sentence, but admits to puzzle -  ment concerning the distinctive contribution made by the occur -  rence of singular terms in such sentences. One way to get into this situation 8   is to begin with a pragmatics, an account of the signifi -  cance of some fundamental kinds of speech act. A line can then be drawn around the   linguistic   by insisting that for the acts in ques -  tion to qualify as   speech   acts, the fundamental kinds must include  asserting.   A general pragmatic theory then specifies for each speech act the circumstances in which, according to the practices of the linguistic community, one counts as entitled or obliged to perform it, and what difference that performance makes to what various interlocutors (the performers included) are thereby enti -  tled or obliged to do. Assertional performances (and thereby specifically linguistic practices) are in turn picked out by   inferen -  tial   articulation: the way in which the pragmatic circumstances and consequences of acts of asserting depend on the inferential relations of ground and consequent among sentences. The cate -  gory of sentences is then defined as comprising the expressions whose (freestanding or unembedded) utterance standardly has the significance of performing a speech act of one of the funda -  mental kinds. A pair of sentences 9   may be said to have the same pragmatic potential if across the whole variety of possible contexts their utterances would be speech acts with the same pragmatic sig -  nificance (Fregean force).  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  13 0   What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?  Frege’s notion of   substitution   can then be employed again to define subsentential categories of linguistic expression. Two sub -  sentential expressions belong to the same syntactic or grammatical category just in case no well-formed sentence (expression that can be used to perform one of the fundamental kinds of speech act) in which the one occurs can be turned into something that is not a sentence merely by substituting the other for it. Two subsenten -  tial expressions of the same grammatical category share a semantic content just in case substituting one for the other preserves the pragmatic potential of the sentences in which they occur. Then the intersubstitution of co-contentful subsentential expressions can be required to preserve the semantic contents of the sentences (and other expressions) they occur in. In this way, the notion of substitution allows both syntactic and semantic equivalence rela -  tions among expressions to be defined, beginning only with an account of force or pragmatic significance. The relations differ only in the substitutional invariants: expressions assimilated ac -  cordingly as well-formedness is preserved by intersubstitution share a syntactic category; those assimilated accordingly as prag -  matic potential is preserved share a semantic content.  There are three sorts of roles that expression kinds can play with respect to this substitutional machinery. An expression can be sub -  stituted   for,   replacing or being replaced by another expression, as a component of a compound expression. An expression can be substituted   in,   as compound expressions in which component expressions (which can be substituted for) occur. Finally, there is the substitutional frame or remainder: what is common to two substituted-in expressions that are substitutional variants of each other (corresponding to different substituted-for expressions): ‘ q   →   r ’ results from ‘ p   →   r ’, by substituting ‘ p ’ for ‘ q ’. The substi -  tutional frame that is common to the two substitutional variants may be indicated by ‘ α →   r ’, in which ‘ α ’ marks a place where an appropriate substituted-for expression would appear.  Being substituted in, substituted for, or a substitutional frame  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?   13 1  are the   substitution-structural roles   that (sets of ) expressions can play. The relation   being a substitutional variant of   obtains be -  tween substituted-in expressions, which must accordingly already have been discerned. Substitutional variation is indexed by pairs of expressions that are substituted for, which accordingly also must be antecedently distinguishable. 10   Substitution frames, by con -  trast, are not raw materials of the substitution process; they are its products. To discern the occurrence of a substitution frame, for instance, ‘ �   →   r   ’ in ‘ p   →   r   ’, is to conceive of ‘ p   →   r   ’as paired with the set of all of its substitutional variants, such as ‘ q   →   r   ’. These are available only after a substitution relation has been instituted. For this reason, being substituted for and being substituted in may be said to be   basic   substitution-structural roles, while being a substitution frame is a (substitutionally)   derived   substitution -  structural role.  Frege was the first to use distinctions such as these to character -  ize the roles of singular terms and predicates. Frege’s idea is that predicates are the substitutional sentence frames formed when singular terms are substituted-for in sentences. 11   That is why predicates do, and singular terms do not, have argument places and fixed adicities. But it is clear that playing the substitution -  structural roles of substituted-for and frame with respect to sub -  stitutions in sentences is not by itself sufficient to permit the identification of expressions as singular terms and predicates, respectively. For, as in the schematic example of the previous para -  graph, what is substituted for may be sentences rather than singu -  lar terms, and the frames exhibited by substitutionally variant (sets of ) sentences thereby become sentential connectives or operators rather than predicates. 12   The substitution-structural roles do pro- vide important necessary conditions for being singular terms and predicates, though.  Why not think of predicates also as expressions that can be substituted for? If “Kant admired Rousseau” has “Rousseau ad -  mired Rousseau” as a substitutional variant when the category  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  13 2   What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?  substituted for is terms, does it not also have “Kant was more punctual than Rousseau” as a substitutional variant when the cate -  gory substituted for is predicates? Indeed, doesn’t talk about predicates as a category of expression presuppose the possibility of such replacement of one predicate by another, given the substitu -  tional definition of ‘category’ offered above? It does; but though either notion can be used to assimilate expressions accordingly as it preserves well-formedness of sentences, it is important to distin -  guish between   substituting   one expression for another and   replac -  ing   one sentence frame with another.  To begin with, it should not be forgotten that the frames on which replacement operates must themselves be understood as products of the former sort of substitution operation. What play the substitutionally derivative roles, for instance, of sentence frames, can be counted as   expressions   only in an extended sense. They are more like   patterns   discernible in sentential expressions, or sets of such expressions, than like parts of them. Sentence frames are what Dummett calls   complex   predicates, not   simple  ones. A sentence frame is not a prior constituent of a sentence but a product of analyzing it, in particular by assimilating to other sen -  tences related to it as substitutional variants, when one or more of its actual constituents is substituted for. As a result, relative to such an analysis a sentence can exhibit many occurrences of expressions that can be substituted for, but only one frame result -  ing from such substitutions. A further difference, which is also a consequence of the substitutionally derivative status of sentence frames, is that replacing sentence frames, or more generally dis -  cerning substitutional variants in the second, wider, sense, which involves replacement of derived categories, requires matching argument places and keeping track of cross-referencing among them. 13   This has no analog in substitution for expressions of substitutionally basic categories. So although replacement of de -  rivative expressions is sufficiently like substitution for basic expres -  sions to define syntactic equivalence classes of expressions, they differ in ways that will later be seen to be important.

Semantics: Substitution-Inferential Significances  Now let me say something about   semantics.   Following the line of thought introduced in Chapter   1   gives us the clue that raising the issue of the   inferential   significance of the occurrence in a sentence of some kind of subsentential expression is what shifts concern from the syntactic consequences of substitutional relations to their specifically semantic significance.  Inferences that relate substitutionally variant substituted-in sen -  tences as premise and conclusion may be called   substitution infer -  ences.   An example is the inference from  Benjamin Franklin invented bifocals  to  The first postmaster general of the United States invented bifocals.  The premised sentence is substituted   in,   and a singular term is substituted   for,   to yield the conclusion. Because Benjamin Franklin was the first postmaster general of the United States, the inference from the premise to its substitutional variant is truth -  preserving: in the appropriate context, commitment to the premise involves commitment to the conclusion.  The substitution inference above   materially involves   the partic -  ular singular terms that occur (and are substituted for) in it. The particular predicate is not materially involved. For it is possible to replace that predicate with others without affecting the correct -  ness (in this case, status-preservingness) of the inference. Thus if “ α   invented bifocals” is replaced by “ α   walked,” the substitution inference from  Benjamin Franklin walked  to  The first postmaster general of the United States walked  will be correct under the same assumptions as the original.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  13 4   What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?  The idea of replacing substitutional frames permits, for in -  stance, the substitution instances quantified over in “Anyone who admires someone admires himself,” such as  Rousseau admires Montaigne and Rousseau admires Rousseau  to appear as   frame-variants   of  Rousseau writes about Montaigne and Rousseau writes about  Rousseau,  when “ α   admires   β   and   α   admires   α ” is replaced by “ α   writes about   β   and   α   writes about   α .” The notion of substitution infer -  ence may be broadened to include inferences whose conclusion results from the premise upon replacement of a substitutional frame or pattern it exhibits. That is, the conclusions of inferences to be called ‘substitution inferences’ may be   either   frame variants or strict substitutional variants of the premises (corresponding to basic and derived substitutional variation).  The substitution inferences (in this broad sense) in which sin -  gular terms are materially involved differ in their formal structure from the substitution inferences in which predicates are materially involved. This difference provides another way of distinguishing the characteristic role of singular terms from that of other sub -  sentential expressions, paradigmatically predicates. The point is noted by Strawson (in   Subject and Predicate in Logic and Gram -  mar ), who observes that predicates, but not singular terms, stand in “one-way inferential involvements.” If the inference from “Benjamin Franklin walked” to “The inventor of bifocals walked” is a good one, then so is that from “The inventor of bifocals walked” to “Benjamin Franklin walked.” Substitutions for singu -  lar terms yield reversible inferences. But it does not follow that the inference from “Benjamin Franklin moved” to “Benjamin Franklin walked” is a good one just because the inference from “Benjamin Franklin walked” to “Benjamin Franklin moved” is a good one. Replacements of predicates need not yield reversible  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?   13 5  inferences. Substitution inferences materially involving singular terms are de jure symmetric, while all predicates are materially involved in some asymmetric substitution inferences (though they may be involved in some symmetric ones as well).  One way to think about this difference is that where the good -  ness of a substitution inference is defined by its preservation of some semantically relevant whatsit, reflexivity and transitivity of those inferences is guaranteed by the nature of the preservation relation. The stuttering inference from   p   to   p   preserves any status that   p   might be accorded, while if the inference from   p   to   q   pre -  serves that status, and that from   q   to   r   preserves it, then so must that from   p   to   r.   The symmetry of the relation, however, is assured neither by its status as an inferential relation nor by its holding accordingly as some status of the premise is preserved or transmit -  ted 14   to the conclusion. Predicate substitution inferences may be asymmetric, while singular term substitution inferences are always symmetric.  So singular terms are grouped into equivalence classes by the good substitution inferences in which they are materially involved, while predicates are grouped into reflexive, transitive,   a symmetric structures or families. That is to say that some predicates are sim -  ply inferentially weaker than others, in the sense that everything that follows from the applicability of the weaker one follows also from the applicability of the stronger one, but not vice versa. The criteria or circumstances of appropriate application of ‘. . . walks’ form a proper subset of those of ‘. . . moves’. Singular terms, by contrast, are not materially involved in substitution inferences whose conclusions are inferentially weaker than their premises. 15  To introduce a singular term into a language, one must specify not only criteria of application but also criteria of identity, specifying which expressions are intersubstitutable with it.  Each member of such an inferential interchangeability equiva -  lence class provides, symmetrically and indifferently, both suffi -  cient conditions for the appropriate application and appropriate  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  13 6   What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?  necessary consequences of application for each of the other expressions in the class. 16   So, when the material substitution -  inferential commitments that govern the use of singular terms are made explicit as the contents of assertional commitments, they take the form of identity claims. Identity locutions permit the expression of claims that have the significance of intersubstitution licenses. Weakening inferences, the one-way inferential involve -  ments that collectively constitute the asymmetric substitutional significance of the occurrence of predicate expressions, are made assertionally explicit by the use of quantified conditionals. Thus, “Benjamin Franklin is (=) the inventor of bifocals” and “Anything that walks, moves.”  3 .   Simple Material Substitution-Inferential Commitments  The substitution inference from “The inventor of bifocals wrote about electricity” to “The first postmaster general of the United States wrote about electricity” is a material inference. Part of my associating the material content I do with the term “the inventor of bifocals” consists in the commitment I undertake to the good -  ness of the substitution inferences that correspond to replace -  ments of occurrences of that term by occurrences of “the first postmaster general of the United States” (and vice versa). That commitment has a general substitution-inferential significance, which is to say that the particular material inference endorsed above is correct as an instance of a general pattern. That same material substitutional commitment regarding “the inventor of bifocals” and “the first postmaster general of the United States” governs also the propriety of the inference from “The inventor of bifocals was a printer” to “The first postmaster general of the United States was a printer,” also that from “The inventor of bifo -  cals spoke French” to “The first postmaster general of the United States spoke French,” as well as a myriad of others. So one simple material substitution-inferential commitment regarding two ex-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?   13 7  pressions determines the correctness of a great many substitution inferences materially involving those expressions, across a great variety of substituted-in sentences and residual sentence frames.  Also, the substitution inferences to and from “The inventor of bifocals was a printer” are determined by all the simple material substitution-inferential commitments (SMSICs) that link the ex -  pression “the inventor of bifocals” with another. Nevertheless, not all occurrences of those expressions have their substitution -  inferential significances determined in this way. For instance, it does not settle the propriety of the substitution inference from  The current postmaster general of the United States believes that  the first postmaster general of the United States was a printer  to  The current postmaster general of the United States believes  that the inventor of bifocals was a printer. 17  These   observations   motivate   the   discrimination   of   certain occurrences of an expression, in a syntactic sense of ‘occurrence’, as in addition semantically significant occurrences of it. A subsen -  tential expression has a syntactic occurrence as a component of (is exhibited by) a sentence just in case it is replaceable by other expressions of its category (either in the original sense of being substituted for or in the secondhand sense appropriate to expres -  sions of substitutionally derived categories), saving sentencehood. (Syntactic categories are interreplaceability equivalence classes, since replacement is reversible and preservation of sentencehood symmetric.) For an occurrence of an expression in this syntactic sense   to   count   also   as   having   primary   substitution-semantic occurrence in a sentence, the substitution inferences to and from that sentence, in which that expression is materially involved, must be governed (their proprieties determined) by the set of simple material substitution-inferential commitments that link that expression with another. 18  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  13 8   What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?  How do SMSICs relating subsentential expressions settle the correctness of the substitution inferences in which the sentences exhibiting primary substitution-semantic occurrences of those expressions figure as premises and conclusions? According to a general pattern. A material substitution-inferential commitment regarding   A   and   A ′   is a commitment to the effect that for any   B  such that   AB   is a sentence in which   A   has primary substitution -  semantic occurrence, the inference from   AB   to   A ′ B   is good. Like -  wise, a material substitution-inferential commitment regarding   B  and   B   ′   is a commitment to the effect that for any   A   such that   AB   is a sentence in which   B   has primary substitution-semantic occur -  rence, the inference from   AB   to   AB   ′   is good. Five points may be noted concerning this structure relating substitutional commit -  ments to substitutional inferences.  First,   all   of the substitution inferences in which a sentence such as   AB   figures as premise or as conclusion are determined accord -  ing to this pattern by all of the SMSICs dealing with expressions having primary substitution-semantic occurrences in   AB   (which might, but need not, be just   A   and   B ). Second, responsibility for those proprieties of substitution inferences to and from a sentence is apportioned between the various subsentential expressions hav -  ing primary occurrences in it, with the SMSICs dealing with a par -  ticular expression responsible for the inferences in which that expression is materially involved. The content (determiner of material proprieties of inference) of each expression is represented by the set of SMSICs that relate it to other expressions. Only the collaboration of all of the SMSICs corresponding to subsentential expressions having primary occurrence in a sentence settles the correctness of the whole set of substitution inferences it appears in as premise or conclusion. Third, a consequence of this division of labor in the determination of the correctness of material infer -  ences (assigning aspects of it to different sorts of expression) is that material inferential roles are determined thereby for novel compounds of familiar components. So even if no one has ever  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?   13 9  encountered the sentence   A ′ B   ′ ,   the SMSICs cited above deter -  mine a commitment to the propriety of the inference from   AB   to  A ′ B   ′ .   Other SMSICs already in place may in the same way license the inference from   A ′ B   ′   to   A ″ B   ′ ,   and so on. Accumulating the content (what determines material proprieties of inference) to be associated with subsentential expressions in the form of substitu -  tional commitments regarding pairs of expressions, then, permits the projection of material proprieties of substitution inference involving a potentially large set of novel sentences from the pro -  prieties involving relatively few familiar ones. Fourth, on this model it is clear how to understand additions to or alterations of content. For when I discover or decide (what would be expressed explicitly in the claim) that the inventor of bifocals is the inventor of lightning rods, and thereby undertake a new simple material substitution-inferential commitment, the substitution-inferential potentials both of sentences in which these expressions have pri -  mary occurrence and of others substitutionally linked to them are altered in determinate and predictable ways. Fifth, for the same reason, it is easy to understand what is involved in introducing new subsentential vocabulary as expressing novel contents. Such vocabulary will make exactly the same sort of contribution to the strictly inferential contents of sentences that the old vocabulary does, as soon as its use has been tied to that of the old vocabulary by suitable SMSICs.  The criteria of adequacy responded to by these five observa -  tions jointly constitute the   point   of discerning semantically signifi -  cant subsentential structure, once the pragmatic, and so semantic, priority of sentences is acknowledged. Against the background of this sort of understanding of the semantically significant decom -  position of sentences into their components, the formal difference between the material substitutional commitments governing sin -  gular terms and those governing predicates becomes particularly striking. The SMSICs that determine the material inferential sig -  nificance of the occurrence of singular terms are symmetrical: a  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  14 0   What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?  commitment to the correctness of the inference that results from substituting   A ′   for   A   is also a commitment to the correctness of the inference that results from substituting   A   for   A ′ .   The set of SMSICs that determine the material inferential significance of the occurrence of any predicate, by contrast, include asymmet -  ric ones. From this point of view, what is special about singular terms is that the simple material substitution-inferential commit -  ments relating pairs of terms partition the set of terms into equiv -  alence classes. This is what it is for it to be (particular) objects that singular terms purport to refer to. An equivalence class of inter -  substitutable terms stands for an object. It follows from the substi -  tutional definition of the object-specifying equivalence classes of terms that it makes no sense to talk of languages in which there is just one singular term ( pace   ‘the Absolute’ as Bradley and Royce tried to use that expression), nor of objects that can in principle be referred to in only one way (by one term). The SMSICs that con -  fer material inferential content on predicates, by contrast, do not segregate those expressions into equivalence classes, and so do not confer a content that purports to pick out an object. The asym -  metric structure conferred on the material contents of predicates is quite different.  There are, then, two fundamental sorts of substitution-inferen -  tial significance that the occurrence of expressions of various sub -  sentential categories might have: symmetric and asymmetric. The claim so far is that it is a necessary condition for identifying some subsentential expression kind as a predicate that expressions of that kind be materially involved in some asymmetric substitution inferences, while it is a necessary condition for identifying some subsentential expression kind as a singular term that expressions of that kind be materially involved only in symmetric substitution inferences. These paired necessary semantic conditions distin -  guishing singular terms from predicates in terms of substitution -  inferential significance (SIS) may be laid alongside the paired necessary syntactic conditions distinguishing singular terms from predicates in terms of substitution-structural role (SSR). The sug-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?   14 1  gestion then is that these individually necessary conditions, sym -  metric SIS and substituted-for SSR, are jointly sufficient to char -  acterize the use of a kind of expression that distinguishes it as playing the role of singular terms. In the rest of this chapter the expression ‘singular term’ is used to signify expressions that play this dual syntactic and semantic substitutional role. It is to what -  ever expressions play this role that the argument is addressed.  III.   Why Are There Singular Terms?  1 .   Four Alternative Subsentential Analyses  Here is an answer to the question “What are singular terms?”: they are expressions that are substituted for, and whose occur -  rence is symmetrically inferentially significant. The question “Why are there any singular terms?” can now be put more sharply: Why should the expressions that are substituted for be restricted to symmetric inferential significance? What function does this ar -  rangement serve?  It is clear enough why the use of a substitutional scalpel to dis -  sect sentential contents into subsentential components requires distinguishing   expressions   substituted   for   from   substitutional frames. But why should any sort of subsentential expression have a symmetric SIS? And if some sort for some reason must, why should it be what is substituted for rather than the corresponding substitutional frames?  What are the alternatives? They are structured by the previous pair of distinctions, between two sorts of substitution-structural syntactic role and between two sorts of substitution-inferential semantic significance. So the possibilities are:  1 .   substituted   for   is symmetric;   substitutional   frame   is symmetric  2 .   substituted   for   is   a symmetric;   substitutional   frame   is symmetric  3 .   substituted   for   is   a symmetric;   substitutional   frame   is   a symmetric  4 .   substituted   for   is symmetric;   substitutional   frame   is   a symmetric  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  14 2   What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?  The final arrangement ( 4 ) is the one actualized in languages with singular terms. One way to ask why this combination of syn -  tactic and semantic roles is favored is to ask what is wrong with the other ones. What rules out the combinations ( 1 ), ( 2 ), and ( 3 )? What sort of consideration could? The strategy pursued here is to look at the constraints on the expressive power of a language that are imposed by each of those varieties of complex substitutional roles.  The first alternative is a good place to begin, for it is fairly easily eliminated from contention. The semantic point of discerning subsentential structure substitutionally is to codify an antecedent field of inferential proprieties concerning sentences by associating material contents with recombinable subsentential expressions so as to be able to derive those proprieties of inference, and to pro -  ject further ones, according to a general pattern of substitution -  inferential significance of material substitutional commitments. But the substituted-in sentences whose inferences are to be codi -  fied themselves stand in “one-way inferential involvements.” The goodness of an inference may require that when the conclusion is substituted for the premise(s), some status (doxastic or as -  sertional commitment, truth, and so on) is preserved. But the converse replacement need not preserve that status. Substitution inferences are not always reversible, saving correctness. Conclu -  sions are often inferentially weaker than the premises from which they are inferred. A restriction to sentential contents confer -  rable by exclusively symmetrically valid material inferences is a restriction to sentential contents completely unrecognizable as such by us. But if both substituted-for expressions and the substi -  tutional frames that are the patterns according to which they assimilate substituted-in sentences are significant only according to   symmetric   SMSICs,   then   asymmetric   inferential   relations involving substituted-in sentences can never be codified as sub -  stitution   inferences   materially   involving   subsentential   expres -  sions, and so licensed by the SMSICs regarding those expressions. Since the inferences to be codified include asymmetric ones, either  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?   14 3  the substituted-for expressions or the substitutional frames, or both, must be assigned asymmetric substitution-inferential sig -  nificance.  The other two alternatives, ( 2 ) and ( 3 ), are alike in assigning the substituted-for   expressions   asymmetric   substitution-inferential significance. If a good reason can be found for ruling out this combination of syntactic and semantic substitutional roles, then the employment of singular terms and their corresponding sen -  tence frames will have been shown to be necessary. For if it can be shown that what is substituted for must have symmetric substitution-inferential significance, then since by the argument just offered the expressions playing some substitution-structural role must be asymmetric, it will follow that the substitution frames must permit asymmetric substitution. And this is just the combi -  nation of roles that has been put forward as characteristic of singu -  lar terms and predicates.  The first task was to answer the question “What are singular terms?” The answer that has emerged is that they are expressions that on the syntactic side play the substitution-structural role of being substituted for, and on the semantic side have symmetric substitution-inferential significances. The second task is to answer the question “Why are there any singular terms?” by presenting an explanation of why the inferential significance of the occurrence of expressions that are substituted for must be symmetric (and so seg -  regate expressions materially into equivalence classes whose ele -  ments accordingly jointly purport to specify some one object). It takes the form of an argument that certain crucial sorts of expres -  sive power would be lost in a language in which the significance of substituted-for expressions were permitted to be asymmetric.  2 .   The Argument  What is wrong with substituted-for expressions having asym -  metric inferential significances? An asymmetric simple mater -  ial substitution-inferential commitment linking substituted-for  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  14 4   What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?  expressions   a   and   b   is a commitment to the goodness of all the in -  ferences that are instances of a certain pattern. Where   Pa   is any sentence in which   a   has primary occurrence, the inference from  Pa   to   Pb   (the result of substituting   b   for   a   in   Pa ) is a good one, though perhaps its converse is not. The point of discerning pri -  mary occurrences of substituted-for expressions depends on these generalizations. For they provide the link that permits the projec -  tion of proprieties of substitution inference, based on associating particular substituted-fors with material contents in the form of determinate sets of simple substitution-inferential commitments relating their use to that of other substituted-fors. Whether the generalizations that animate asymmetrically significant substitu -  tional commitments regarding substituted-fors make sense or not depends on the contents expressed by the sentences substituted in, and it is this fact that in the end turns out to mandate symmet -  ric substitutional significances for what is substituted for.  In order to see how one might argue against admitting asym -  metrically significant substituted-for expressions, consider what happens if there is a general recipe for producing, given any frame  Q   α ,   a frame   Q   ′α   that is inferentially complementary to it, in the sense that each   Q   ′α   is to be so constructed that whenever the inference from   Qx   to   Q y   is good, but not vice versa (intuitively, because   y   is inferentially weaker than   x,   the way ‘mammal’ is infer -  entially weaker than ‘dog’), the inference from   Q   ′ y   to   Q   ′ x   is good, but not vice versa, for any substituted-for expressions   x   and  y.   Such a situation precludes discerning   any   primary substitution -  semantic occurrences of any substituted-for expressions. There would then be no syntactic occurrences of any substituted-for expressions whose substitution-inferential significance is correctly captured by an asymmetric SMSIC (the symmetric ones are not currently at issue). For an asymmetric substitution-inferential commitment relating   a   to   b   governs inferential proprieties via the generalization that for   any   frame   P α ,   the inference from   Pa   to   Pb  is a good one, though not in general the converse.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?   14 5  Under the hypothesis being considered, no matter what partic -  ular instance   P   α   is chosen, it is possible to construct or choose a complementary predicate,   P   ′α , for which only the complemen -  tary pattern of substitution-inferential proprieties obtains. In the presence of a recipe for producing for arbitrary substitution frames other frames that are inferentially complementary to them, then, no proprieties of substitution inference can be captured by asymmetric SMSICs, and so no primary substitution-semantic occurrences of substituted-for expressions corresponding to them. The upshot of this line of thought, then, is that the existence of asymmetrically significant substituted-for expressions is incom -  patible with the presence in the language of expressive resources sufficient to produce, for arbitrary sentence frames, inferentially complementary ones. To explain why substituted-for subsenten -  tial expressions have symmetric substitution-inferential signifi -  cances, which on the current understanding is to explain why there are singular terms, then, it will suffice to explain what sort of expressive impoverishment a language is condemned to if it eschews the locutions that would permit the general formation of inferentially complementary sentence frames.  When it has been seen that the particular constellation of syn -  tactic and semantic roles characteristic of singular terms is necessi -  tated by the presence in the language of vocabulary meeting this condition, it becomes urgent to see what locutions make possible the production of arbitrary inferentially complementary frames, and how dispensable the role they play in linguistic practice might be. What locutions have this power? Examples are not far to seek. The one to focus on is the   conditional.   Because conditionals make inferential commitments explicit as the contents of assertional commitments, inferentially weakening the antecedent of a condi -  tional inferentially strengthens the conditional. Endorsing all the inferences from sentences exhibiting the frame “ α   is a dog” to the corresponding “ α   is a mammal” does not involve commitment to the goodness of the inferences from sentences exhibiting the  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  14 6   What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?  frame “If   α   is a dog,   α   then belongs to an anciently domesticated species,” to those exhibiting the frame “If   α   is a mammal, then   α  belongs to an anciently domesticated species.” Instances of the first conditional are true claims expressing correct inferences, while instances of its substitution variant are false conditionals expressing incorrect inferences. Quite generally, let   Qa   be a par -  ticular sentence in which the substituted-for expression   a   has pri -  mary occurrence, and   Qb   be a substitutional variant of it, and let   r  be some other sentence. Then   Qa → r   is a sentence in which   a   has primary occurrence, and the symbol   Q   ′α   may be introduced for the sentence frame associated with its occurrence, with the condi -  tional above written as   Q   ′ a.   If   a   is inferentially stronger than   b,  asymmetrically, then the inference from   Qa   to   Q b   is good, but not its converse (Thera is a dog, so Thera is a mammal). 19   But if that is so, then the inference from   Q   ′ a   to   Q   ′ b   cannot be good, for infer -  entially weakening the antecedent of a conditional inferentially strengthens the conditional.  This last formulation suggests another example. Inferentially weakening a claim inside a negation inferentially strengthens the compound negation. If the substitution inference from   Qa   to   Qb  is good but the converse not, then the substitution inference from  ~Qa   to   ~Q b   cannot be good. Embedding as a negated compo -  nent, like embedding as the antecedent of a conditional, reverses inferential polarities. The conclusion is that any language contain -  ing a conditional or negation thereby has the expressive resources to formulate, given any sentence frame, a sentence frame that behaves inferentially in a complementary fashion, thereby ruling out the generalizations that would correspond to asymmetric simple material substitution-inferential commitments governing the expressions that are substituted for in producing such frames.  3 .   The Importance of Logical Sentential Operators  The conditional and negation are fundamental bits of   logical  vocabulary. Is it just a coincidence that it is logical sentence-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?   14 7  compounding locutions that permit the systematic formation of inferentially inverting sentential contexts? The sentence   q   is infer -  entially weaker than the sentence   p   just in case everything that is a consequence of   q   is a consequence of   p,   but not vice versa (conse -  quences are not preserved but pruned). It is an immediate conse -  quence of this definition that inferentially weakening the premises of an inference can turn good inferences into bad ones. The defin -  ing job of the conditional is to codify inferences as claims (make it possible to express inferential commitments explicitly in the form of assertional commitments). It is essential to doing that job that embedded sentences that can play the role of premises and con -  clusions of inferences appear as components, antecedents and consequents, in the conditional. The contexts in which com -  ponent sentences occur as antecedents accordingly must be in -  ferentially inverting. Notice that this argument presupposes very little about the details of the use of the conditional involved. It is enough, for instance, if the conditional has the designated (semantic or pragmatic) status in case the inference it expresses preserves the designated status. As the defining job of the condi -  tional is to codify inferences, that of negation is to codify in -  compatibilities. The negation of a claim is its inferentially minimal incompatible:   ~p   is what is entailed by everything materially in -  compatible with   p. 20   These underlying incompatibilities induce a notion of inferential weakening: “Thera is a dog” incompatibility -  entails, and so is inferentially stronger than, “Thera is a mammal,” because everything incompatible with “Thera is a mammal” is incompatible with “Thera is a dog,” but not vice versa (incompat -  ibilities pruned, not preserved). It follows that incompatibility -  inferentially weakening a negated claim incompatibility-inferentially strengthens the negation. “It is not the case that Thera is a mam -  mal” is incompatibility-inferentially stronger than “It is not the case that Thera is a dog,” just because “Thera is a mammal” is incompatibility-inferentially weaker than “Thera is a dog.” Thus negation also enables the formation of arbitrary inferential comple -  ments. I argued in Chapter   1   that what makes both conditionals  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  14 8   What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?  and negation, so understood, specifically logical vocabulary is that the material inferences and material inference-inducing incompati -  bilities of which they permit the assertionally explicit expression play a central role in conferring material contents on prelogical sentences. It is a direct result of this defining semantically expres -  sive function that they form semantically inverting contexts.  Since it is the availability of such contexts that rules out asym -  metrically significant substituted-for expressions, it follows that a language can have either the expressive power that goes with logi -  cal vocabulary or asymmetrically substitution-inferentially signifi -  cant substituted-for expressions, but not both. It is leaving room for the possibility of logical locutions that enforces the discrimina -  tion of singular terms (and, as a consequence, of predicates) rather than some other sorts of subsentential expression.  Notice that the only logical locutions required for that argument are those whose roles are definable solely in terms of the behavior of   sentences,   before any sort of subsentential substitutional analysis has been undertaken. The argument does not depend on any par -  ticular features of the sentential contents that are available to begin with, which determine the proprieties of material inference that provide the targets for substitutional codification in (implicit or explicit) SMSICs. All that matters is the availability of the expressive power of logical sentential connectives.  But having to do without logical expressions would impoverish linguistic practice in fundamental ways. The use of any contentful sentence involves implicit commitment to the (material) correct -  ness of the inference from the circumstances of appropriate appli -  cation associated with that sentence to the consequences of such application. Introducing conditionals into a language permits these implicit, content-conferring, material-inferential commit -  ments to be made explicit in the form of assertional commitments. This is important at the basic, purely sentential level of analysis for the same reason it becomes important later at the subsentential level, when identity and quantificational locutions can be intro-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?   14 9  duced to make explicit the SMSICs that confer distinguishable material-inferential content on subsentential expressions. In each case, once made explicit in the form of claims, those content -  conferring commitments are brought into the game of giving and asking for reasons. They become subject to explicit objection, for instance, by confrontation with materially incompatible asser -  tions, and equally to explicit justification, for instance, by citation of materially sufficient inferential grounds. The task of forming and nurturing the concepts we talk and think with is brought out of the dim twilight of what remains implicit in unquestioned prac -  tice into the daylight of what becomes explicit as controversial principle. Material contents, once made explicit, can be shaped collectively, as interlocutors in different situations, physically and doxastically, but in concert with their fellows, provide objections and evidence, claims and counterclaims, and explore possible con -  sequences and ways of becoming entitled to assert them. Logic is the linguistic organ of semantic self-consciousness and self -  control. The expressive resources provided by logical vocabulary make it possible to criticize, control, and improve our concepts. To give this up is to give up a lot. 21   Yet, it has been argued, it is a direct (if unobvious) consequence of leaving open the possibility of introducing such inferentially explicitating vocabulary that the subsentential expressions that are substituted for will be singular terms, and their corresponding sentence frames will be predicates, as judged by the symmetric and asymmetric forms of their respec -  tive substitution-inferential significances. 22  IV.   Conclusion  The title of this chapter asks the double question “What are singu -  lar terms, and why are there any?” The strategy of the answer of -  fered to the first query is to focus on substitution. The fundamental unit of language is the sentence, since it is by uttering freestanding  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  15 0   What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?  sentences that speech acts are performed. Thus sentences are fun -  damental in the sense that it is coherent to interpret a community as using (its practices conferring content on) sentences but not subsentential expressions, while it is not coherent to interpret any community as using subsentential expressions but not sentences. But in fact there are good reasons why any community that uses sentences should also be expected to use subsentential expres -  sions, indeed, subsentential expressions of particular kinds.  The notion of substitution provides a route from the dis -  crimination of the fundamental sentential expressions to the discrimination of essentially subsentential expressions. To carve up sentences substitutionally is to assimilate them accordingly as occurrences of the same subsentential expressions are discerned in them. Such a decomposition is accomplished by a set of substitu -  tion transformations. The functional significance of discerning in a sentence an occurrence of one out of a set of expressions that can be substituted for is to treat the sentence as subject to a certain subclass of substitution transformations relating it to other, vari -  ant sentences. So the expressions that are substituting and sub -  stituted for can be used to index the transformations. 23   Two sentences are taken to exhibit the same substitutional sentence frame in case they are substitutional variants of each other, that is, are accessible one from the other by substitution transformations. These substitutional assimilations define two basic substitution -  structural roles that essentially subsentential expression kinds could play. The first half of the answer to the first question “What are singular terms?” is then that   syntactically,   singular terms play the substitution-structural role of being substituted  for,   while predicates play the substitution-structural role of sen -  tence frames.  The second half of the answer to that question is that   se -  mantically,   singular terms are distinguished by their   symmetric  substitution-inferential significance. Thus, if a particular substitu -  tion transformation that corresponds to substituting one singular  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?   15 1  term for another preserves some semantically relevant sentential status (commitment, entitlement, truth, or whatever) when only primary occurrences are involved, no matter what the sentence frame, then the inverse transformation also preserves that status, regardless of frame. By contrast, every sentence frame is involved in weakening inferences, where there is some other frame such that replacing primary occurrences of the first by the second always preserves the relevant sentential status, no matter what structure of substituted-for expressions is exhibited, while the converse replacement is not always status-preserving. Because the simple material substitution-inferential commitments that articulate the semantic content associated with singular terms are symmetric, their transitive closure partitions the set of singular terms into equivalence classes of intersubstitutable substituted-for expressions. It is in virtue of this defining character of their use that singular terms can be said to “purport to refer to just one object.”  The full answer to the question “What are singular terms?” is then that singular terms are substitutionally discriminated, essen -  tially subsentential expressions that play a dual role. Syntactically they play the substitution-structural role of being substituted  for.   Semantically their primary occurrences have a   symmetric  substitution-inferential significance. Predicates, by contrast, are syntactically substitution-structural   frames,   and semantically their primary occurrences have an   asymmetric   substitution-inferential significance. This precise substitutional answer to the first ques -  tion supplies a definite sense to the second one.  To ask why there are singular terms is to ask why expressions that are substituted for (and so of the basic substitution-structural kind) should have their significance governed by symmetric com -  mitments, while sentence frames (expressions of the derivative substitution-structural kind) should have their significance gov -  erned in addition by asymmetric commitments. The strategy pur -  sued in answer to this question is to focus on the use of logical  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  15 2   What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?  vocabulary to permit the explicit   expression,   as the content of sen -  tences, of relations among sentences that are partly constitutive of their being contentful. To say that subsentential expressions are used by a community as substituted-fors and substitution -  structural frames is to say that the contents conferred by the practices of the community on the sentences in which those expressions have primary occurrence are related systematically to one another in such a way that they can be exhibited as the prod -  ucts of contents associated with the subsentential expressions, according to a standard substitutional structure. The problem of why there are singular terms arises because that structure need not, for all that has just been said, assume the specific form that defines singular terms and predicates.  But suppose the condition is added that the sentences whose proper use must be codifiable in terms of the proper use of their subsentential components is to include (or be capable of being extended so as to include) not only logically atomic sentences, but also sentences formed using the fundamental sentential logical vocabulary, paradigmatically conditionals and negation. This con -  dition turns out to interact in intricate ways with the possibility of substitutional codification of sentential contents by subsentential ones—ways that when followed out can be seen to require just the combination of syntactic and semantic substitutional roles charac -  teristic of singular terms and predicates. So the answer offered is that the existence of singular terms (and so of their complemen -  tary predicates) is the result of a dual expressive necessity. On the one hand, the material-inferential and material-incompatibility commitments regarding sentences must be implicitly substitu -  tionally codifiable in terms of material-inferential and material -  incompatibility commitments regarding the subsentential expres -  sions that can be discerned within them or into which they can be analyzed, if the contents of novel sentences are to be projectable. On the other hand, those same commitments regarding sentences must be explicitly logically codifiable as the contents of assertional  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?   15 3  commitments, if the contents of nonlogical (as well as logical) sentences are to be available for public inspection, debate, and attempts at improvement. It is these two expressive demands, each intelligible entirely in terms of considerations arising already at the sentential level, that jointly give rise to the structure of sym -  metrically significant substituted-fors and asymmetrically signifi -  cant substitution-structural sentence frames that defines the func -  tional roles of singular terms and predicates.  This argument may be called an   expressive deduction   of the necessity of basic subsentential structure taking the form of terms and predicates. A language must be taken to have expressions functioning as singular terms if essentially subsentential structure is (substitutionally) discerned in it at all, and the language is expressively rich enough to contain fundamental sentential logi -  cal locutions—paradigmatically conditionals—which permit the assertionally explicit expression of material-inferential relations among nonlogical sentences, and negations, which permit the assertionally explicit expression of material-incompatibility rela -  tions among nonlogical sentences.  Logical vocabulary has the expressive role of making   explicit,   in the form of logically compound assertible sentential contents, the  implicit   material commitments in virtue of which logically atomic sentences   have   the   contents   that   they   do.   Logic   transforms semantic practices into principles. By providing the expressive tools permitting us to endorse in what we say what before we could endorse only in what we did, logic makes it possible for the development of the concepts by which we conceive our world and our plans (and so ourselves) to rise in part above the indistinct realm of mere tradition, of evolution according to the results of the thoughtless jostling of the habitual and the fortuitous, and enter the comparatively well lit discursive marketplace, where rea -  sons are sought and proffered, and every endorsement is liable to being put on the scales and found wanting. The expressive deduc -  tion argues that subsentential structure takes the specific form of  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  15 4   What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?  singular terms and predicates because only in that way can the full expressive benefits of substitutional subsentential analysis—codi -  fying material correctnesses implicit in the use of sentences in material correctnesses implicit in the use of subsentential expres -  sions—be combined with those afforded by the presence of full -  blooded logical vocabulary of various sorts, performing its task of making explicit in claims what is implicit in the practical applica -  tion of concepts.  In other words, languages have singular terms rather than some other kind of expression so that logic can help us talk and think in those languages about what we are doing, and why, when we talk and think in those languages. The full play of expressive power of even purely sentential logical vocabulary turns out to be incompatible with every sort of substitutional subsentential analysis save that in which essentially subsentential expressions playing the substitution-structural role of being substituted for have symmetric substitution-inferential significances, and those playing the substitution-structural role of sentence frames have asymmetric substitution-inferential significances. For to play its inference-explicitating role, the conditional, for instance, must form compound sentences whose antecedent substitution posi -  tion is inferentially inverting. Only symmetrically significant ex -  pressions can be substituted for, and so form sentence frames, in such a context. That is why in languages with conditionals, subsentential structure takes the form of singular terms and predicates.  At the beginning of this chapter I pointed out that the principle that singular terms are used to talk about particular objects can be exploited according to two complementary directions of explana -  tion. One might try to give an account of what particulars are, without using the concept   singular term,   and then proceed to define what it is to use an expression as a singular term by appeal to the relation of such terms to particulars. Or one might try to give an account of what singular terms are without using the con-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any?   15 5  cept   particular,   and then proceed to define what it is for some -  thing to be a particular by appeal to the relations of particulars to expressions used as terms. (It should of course be admitted that in either case the talking about relation will require substantial expla -  nation, though that explanation may have to look quite different depending on which explanatory strategy it is conceived as abet -  ting.) The answer presented here to the question “What are sin -  gular terms?” does not appeal to the concept of objects. So it provides just the sort of account required by the first stage of the second, Kant-Frege strategy for explaining the concept of objects.  It is worth pointing out that in the context of this order of explanation, to explain why there are singular terms is in an important sense to explain why there are objects—not why there is something (to talk about) rather than nothing (at all), but rather why what we talk about comes structured as propertied and related objects: “The limits of language (of that language which alone I understand) means the limits of my world.” 24   To ask the question “Why are there singular terms?” is one way of asking the question “Why are there objects?” How odd and marvelous that the answer to both should turn out to be: Because it is so impor -  tant to have something that means what   conditionals   mean!

Background  1 .   Thinking and Thinking About  One useful way of dividing up the broadly cognitive capacities that constitute our mindedness is to distinguish between our sen -  tience and our sapience. Sentience is what we share with nonver -  bal animals such as cats—the capacity to be   aware   in the sense of being   awake.   Sentience, which so far as our understanding yet reaches is an exclusively biological phenomenon, is in turn to be distinguished from the mere reliable differential responsiveness we sentients share with artifacts such as thermostats and land mines. Sapience, by contrast, concerns   understanding   or intelli -  gence rather than irritability or arousal. One is treating something as sapient insofar as one explains its behavior by attributing to it intentional states such as belief and desire as constituting   reasons  for that behavior. Sapients act as though reasons matter to them. They are rational agents in the sense that their behavior can be made intelligible, at least sometimes, by attributing to them the capacity to make practical inferences concerning how to get what they want, and theoretical inferences concerning what follows from what.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  15 8   A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing  Besides thinking of sapience in terms of reasons and inference, it is natural to think of it in terms of truth. Sapients are believers, and believing is taking-true. Sapients are agents, and acting is making-true. To be sapient is to have states such as belief, desire, and intention, which are contentful in the sense that the question can appropriately be raised under what circumstances what is believed, desired, or intended would be   true.   Understanding such a content is grasping the conditions that are necessary and suffi -  cient for its truth.  These two ways of conceiving sapience, in terms of inference and in terms of truth, have as their common explanatory target contents distinguished as intelligible by their   propositional   form. What we can offer as a reason, what we can take or make true, has a propositional content, a content of the sort that we express by the use of declarative sentences and ascribe by the use of ‘that’ clauses. Propositional contents stand in inferential relations, and they have truth conditions.  Whether we think of propositional content in terms of truth or in terms of reasons, we are still obliged to discuss also aboutness and representation. When we try to understand the thought or discourse of others, the task can be divided initially into two parts: understanding what they are thinking or talking about and under -  standing what they are thinking or saying about it. My primary aim here is to present a view of the relation between what is   said   or  thought   and what it is said or thought   about.   The former is the propositional dimension of thought and talk, and the latter is its  representational   dimension. The question I address is why any state or utterance that has propositional content also should be understood as having representational content. (For this so much as to be a question, it must be possible to characterize proposi -  tional content in nonrepresentational terms.)  The answer I defend is that the representational dimension of propositional contents should be understood in terms of their  social   articulation—how a propositionally contentful belief or claim can have a different significance from the perspective of the  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing   15 9  individual believer or claimer, on the one hand, than it does from the perspective of one who attributes that belief or claim to the individual, on the other. The context within which concern with what is thought and talked   about   arises is the assessment of how the judgments of one individual can serve as reasons for another. The representational content of claims and the beliefs they express reflect the social dimension of the game of giving and asking for reasons.  2 .   Kant  It may be remarked at the outset that it will not do just to think of the representational dimension of semantic contentfulness according to a designational paradigm—that is, on the model of the relation between a name and what it is a name of. For that relation is a   semantic   relation only in virtue of what one can go on to   do   with what is picked out by the name—what one can then   say  about it. Merely picking out an object or a possible state of affairs is not enough. What about it? One must say something about the object, claim that the state of affairs obtains or is a fact.  One of Kant’s epoch-making insights, confirmed and secured for us also by Frege and Wittgenstein, is his recognition of the  primacy of the propositional.   The pre-Kantian tradition took it for granted that the proper order of semantic explanation begins with a doctrine of concepts or terms, divided into singular and general, whose meaningfulness can be grasped independently of and prior to the meaningfulness of judgments. Appealing to this basic level of interpretation, a doctrine of judgments then explains the com -  bination of concepts into judgments, and how the correctness of the resulting judgments depends on what is combined and how. Appealing to this derived interpretation of judgments, a doctrine of consequences finally explains the combination of judgments into inferences, and how the correctness of inferences depends on what is combined and how.  Kant rejects this. One of his cardinal innovations is the claim  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  16 0   A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing  that the fundamental unit of awareness or cognition, the mini -  mum graspable, is the   judgment.   Judgments are fundamental, since they are the minimal unit one can take   responsibility   for on the cognitive side, just as actions are the corresponding unit of responsibility on the practical side. (The Transcendental Unity of Apperception is a unity defined by an equivalence relation of   core -  sponsibility.   The “emptiest of all representations,” the “ ‘I think’ that can accompany all representations” expresses the formal dimension of responsibility   for   judgments. The “object = X,” con -  cern for which distinguishes transcendental from general logic, expresses the formal dimension of judgments’ responsibility   to  something. Thus concepts can be understood only as abstractions, in terms of the role they play in judging. A concept just is a predi -  cate of a possible judgment, 1   which is why   “The only use which the understanding can make of concepts is to form judgments by them.”   2  For Kant, any discussion of content must start with the contents of judgments, since anything else has content only insofar as it contributes to the contents of judgments. This is why his tran -  scendental logic can investigate the presuppositions of contentful -  ness in terms of the categories, that is, the “functions of unity in judgment.” 3   This explanatory strategy is taken over by Frege, for whom the semantic notion of conceptual content ultimately has the theoretical task of explaining pragmatic   force —the paradig -  matic variety of which is   assertional   force, which attaches only to declarative sentences. As the later Wittgenstein puts the point, only the utterance of a sentence makes a move in the language game. Applying a concept is to be understood in terms of making a claim or expressing a belief. The concept   concept   is not intelli -  gibe apart from the possibility of such application in   judging.  The lesson is that the relation between designation and what is designated can be understood only as an aspect of judging or claiming   that   something (expressed by a declarative sentence, not by a singular term or predicate by itself ) is so, that is, is   true.   That is judging, believing, or claiming   that   a proposition or claim is  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing   16 1  true (expresses or states a fact),   that   something is   true of   an object or collection of objects,   that   a predicate is   true of   something else. Thus one must be concerned with what is said or expressed, as well as what it is said   of   or true   of —the thought as well as what the thought is   about.  3 .   Inference and Content  Accordingly we start our story with an approach to propositional contents: what can be   said   or   believed   or   thought,   in general, what can be   taken   (to be)   true.   The guiding idea is that the essential fea -  ture distinguishing what is propositionally contentful is that it can serve both as a premise and as the conclusion of   inferences.   Taking (to be) true is treating as a fit premise for inferences. This is exploiting Frege’s semantic principle—that good inferences never lead from true premises to conclusions that are not true—not in order to define good inferences in terms of their preservation of truth, but rather to define truth as what is preserved by good inferences.  On the side of propositionally contentful   intentional states,   par -  adigmatically   belief,   the essential inferential articulation of the propositional is manifested in the form of intentional interpreta -  tion or explanation. Making behavior intelligible according to this model is taking the individual to act for   reasons.   This is what lies behind Dennett’s slogan, “Rationality is the mother of inten -  tion.” The role of belief in imputed pieces of practical reasoning, leading from beliefs and desires to the formation of intentions, is essential to intentional explanation—and so is reasoning in which both premise and conclusion have the form of believables.  On the side of propositionally contentful   speech acts,   paradig -  matically assertion, the essential inferential articulation of the propositional is manifested in the fact that the core of specifically  linguistic   practice is the game of giving and asking for   reasons.  Claiming or asserting is what one must do in order to give a  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  16 2   A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing  reason, and it is a speech act that reasons can be demanded for. Claims both serve as and stand in need of reasons or justifications. They have the contents they have in part in virtue of the role they play in a network of inferences.  Indeed, the   conceptual   should be distinguished precisely by its inferential articulation. This is a point on which traditional empiri -  cism needed instruction by traditional rationalism. What is the dif -  ference between a parrot or a thermostat that represents a light as being red or a room as being cold by exercising its reliable differ -  ential responsive disposition to utter the noise “That’s red” or to turn on the furnace, on the one hand, and a knower who does so by applying the concepts   red   and   cold,   on the other? What is the knower able to   do   that the parrot and the thermostat cannot? After all, they may respond differentially to   just   the same range of stimuli. The knower is able to   use   the differentially elicited response in   inference.   The knower has the practical know-how to situate that response in a network of inferential relations—to tell what follows from something being red or cold, what would be evidence for it, what would be incompatible with it, and so on. For the knower, taking something to be red or cold is making a move in the game of giving and asking for reasons—a move that can justify other moves, be justified by still other moves, and that closes off or precludes still further moves. The parrot and the thermostat lack the concepts in spite of their mastery of the corre -  sponding noninferential differential responsive dispositions, pre -  cisely because they lack the practical mastery of the inferential articulation in which grasp of conceptual content consists.  The idea, then, is to start with a story about the sayable, think -  able, believable (and so propositional) contents expressed by the use   of   declarative   sentences   and   ‘that’   clauses   derived   from them—a story couched in terms of their roles in   inference. 4   Con -  ceptual content is in the first instance   inferentially   articulated. To approach the representational dimension of semantic content from this direction, it is necessary to ask about the relation  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing   16 3  between   inference   and   reference.   This is to ask about the relation between what is said or thought and what it is said or thought  about.   How can the representational dimension of conceptual content be brought into the inferential picture or propositional contents? The thesis to be elaborated here is that the representa -  tional dimension of discourse reflects the fact that conceptual content is not only   inferentially   articulated but also   socially   articu -  lated. The game of giving and asking for reasons is an essentially  social   practice.  4 .   The Normative Character of Concept Use  The rationale for such a claim emerges most clearly from consider -  ation of certain very general features of discursive practice. Here it is useful to start with another of Kant’s fundamental insights, into the   normative   character of the significance of what is conceptually contentful. His idea is that judgments and actions are above all things that we are   responsible   for. Kant understands concepts as having the form of   rules,   which is to say that they specify how something   ought   (according to the rule) to be done. The under -  standing, the conceptual faculty, is the faculty of grasping rules, of appreciating the distinction between correct and incorrect appli -  cation they determine. Judgings and doings are acts that have contents that one can take or make true and for which the demand for reasons is in order. What is distinctive about them is the way they are governed by rules. Being in an intentional state or per -  forming an intentional action has a normative significance. It counts as undertaking (acquiring) an obligation or commitment; the content of the commitment is determined by the rules that are the concepts in terms of which the act or state is articulated. Thus Kant picks us out as distinctively normative or rule-governed creatures.  Descartes inaugurated a new philosophical era by conceiving of what he took to be the ontological distinction between the mental  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  16 4   A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing  and the physical in epistemological terms, in terms of accessibility to cognition, in terms, ultimately, of certainty. Kant launched a new philosophical epoch by shifting the center of concern from  certainty   to   necessity.   Whereas Descartes’s descriptive conception of intentionality, centering on certainty, picks out as essential our grip on the concepts employed in cognition and action, Kant’s normative conception of intentionality, centering on necessity, treats their grip on us as the heart of the matter. The attempt to understand the source, nature, and significance of the norms implicit in our concepts—both those that govern the theoretical employment of concepts in inquiry and knowledge and those that govern their practical employment in deliberation and action— stands at the very center of Kant’s philosophical enterprise. The most urgent question for Kant is how to understand the   rulishness  of concepts, how to understand their   authority, bindingness,   or  validity.   It is this normative character that he calls   Notwendigkeit,  “necessity.”  The lesson to be learned from this Kantian normative concep -  tual pragmatics is that judging and acting are distinguished from other doings by the kind of   commitment   they involve. Judging or claiming is staking a claim—undertaking a commitment. The con -  ceptual articulation of these commitments, their status as distinc -  tively   discursive   commitments, consists in the way they are liable to demands for   justification,   and the way they serve both to justify some further commitments and to preclude the justification of some other commitments. Their propositional contentfulness consists precisely in this inferential articulation of commitments and entitlements to those commitments.  Specifically   linguistic   practices are those in which some perfor -  mances are accorded the significance of assertions or claimings— the undertaking of inferentially articulated (and so propositionally contentful) commitments. 5   Mastering such linguistic practices is a matter of learning how to keep score on the inferentially articu -  lated commitments and entitlements of various interlocutors,  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing   16 5  oneself included. Understanding a speech act—grasping its discur -  sive significance—is being able to attribute the right commitments in response. This is knowing how it changes the score of what the performer and the audience are committed and entitled to.  One way of thinking about the claims by which discursive com -  mitments are expressed is in terms of the interaction of in -  ferentially articulated   authority   and   responsibility.   In making an assertion, one lends to the asserted content one’s   authority,   licens -  ing others to undertake a corresponding commitment to use as a premise in   their   reasoning. Thus one essential aspect of this model of discursive practice is   communication:   the interpersonal, intra -  content inheritance of entitlement to commitments. In making an assertion one also undertakes a   responsibility —to justify the claim if appropriately challenged, and thereby to redeem one’s entitle -  ment to the commitment acknowledged by the claiming. Thus another essential aspect of this model of discursive practice is   jus -  tification:   the intrapersonal, intercontent inheritance of entitle -  ment to commitments.  II.   Analysis  1 .   Representation and Communication  One can pick out what is   propositionally   contentful to begin with as whatever can serve both as a premise and as a conclusion in  inference —what can be offered as, and itself stand in need of,   rea -  sons.   Understanding or grasping such a propositional content is a kind of know-how—practical mastery of the game of giving and asking for reasons, being able to tell what is a reason for what, dis -  tinguish good reasons from bad. To play such a game is to keep  score   on what various interlocutors are committed and entitled to. Understanding the content of a speech act or a belief is being able to accord the performance of that speech act or the acquisition of that belief the proper practical significance—knowing how it  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  16 6   A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing  would change the score in various contexts. Semantic, that is to begin with, inferential, relations are to be understood in terms of this sort of pragmatic scorekeeping. Taking it that the claim expressed by one sentence entails the claim expressed by another is treating anyone who is committed to the first as thereby com -  mitted to the second. We typically think about inference solely in terms of the relation between premise and conclusion, that is, as a monological relation among propositional contents. Discursive practice, the giving and asking for reasons, however, involves both inter content   and inter personal   relations. The claim is that the rep -  resentational aspect of the propositional contents that play the inferential roles of premise and conclusion should be understood in terms of the social or dialogical dimension of communicating reasons, of assessing the significance of reasons offered by others.  If whatever plays a suitable role in inference is propositionally contentful, and whatever is propositionally contentful therefore also has representational content, then nothing can deserve to count as specifically   inferential   practice unless it at least implicitly involves a representational dimension. Nonetheless, one can give sufficient conditions for a social practice to qualify as according  inferentially articulated   significances to performances, that is, to be a practice of making claims that can serve as reasons for others, and for which reasons can be demanded, without using any specif -  ically representational vocabulary. That is what the model of discursive practice as keeping score on commitments and entitle -  ments does. The story I want to tell, then, is how the implicit rep -  resentational dimension of the inferential contents of claims arises out of the difference in social perspective between   producers   and  consumers   of reasons. The aim is an account in nonrepresenta -  tional terms of what is expressed by the use of explicitly represen -  tational vocabulary.  The connection between   representation,   on the one hand, and  communication   or the   social   dimension of inferential practice, on the other, is sufficiently unobvious that I want to start with two  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing   16 7  quick points that may help show why one could so much as think that representation could be understood in these terms. Consider a rational reconstruction of the dialectic that led Quine to displace  meaning   as the central semantic concept in favor of   reference,   in the wake of “Two Dogmas of Empiricism.” Quine had taken it that meaning must at least determine inferential role. But what follows from endorsing a claim—what else that endorsement commits one to—depends on what concomitant commitments are available to serve as auxiliary hypotheses in extracting those inferential consequences. So the inferential significance of a belief depends on what else one believes. Thus the unit of meaning should be taken to be a whole theory, not just a single sentence. But this means that if two interlocutors have different beliefs, they mean different things by the sentences they utter. On this account it is not clear how the possibility of communication can be made intelligible as a matter of sharing meanings. But if attention is shifted instead to   reference,   the difficulty disappears. The Zoroas -  trian may   mean   something different by the word ‘sun’ than I do (it has a different meaning in her mouth than in my ear) because of the difference in her collateral commitments, but she can still be talking   about   the same thing, the sun. Equally significantly, though Rutherford may have meant something different by ‘elec -  tron’ than I do, we can still be understood as referring to the same things, electrons, and classifying them as falling in the same exten -  sion, that of subatomic particles. So talk of what one is talking  about   addresses worries that would otherwise be raised by theories of meaning with   holistic   consequences. More important in the cur -  rent context, a concern with explaining the possibility of   commu -  nication   can lead to a concern with   reference   and   representation.  The second point in some ways reverses this order of approach.  The overall claim I am concerned with is that assessment of what people are talking and thinking   about,   rather than what they are saying about it, is a feature of the essentially   social   context of  communication.   Talk about representation is talk about what it is  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  16 8   A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing  to secure communication by being able to use one another’s judg -  ments as reasons, as premises in our own inferences, even just hypothetically, to assess their significance in the context of our own collateral commitments. As one way to get a preliminary taste for how one could think that representational semantic talk could be understood as expressing differences in social perspective among interlocutors, consider how assessments of   truth   work. Perhaps the central context in which such assessments classically arise is attributions of   knowledge.   According to the traditional JTB account, knowledge is justified true belief. Transposed into a spec -  ification of a normative status something could be taken to have by interlocutors who are keeping score of one another’s commit -  ments and entitlements, this account requires that in order for it to be   knowledge   that a scorekeeper takes another to have, that scorekeeper must adopt three sorts of practical attitude. First, the scorekeeper must   attribute   an inferentially articulated, hence propositionally contentful,   commitment.   This corresponds to the  belief   condition on knowledge. Second, the scorekeeper must  attribute   a sort of inferential   entitlement   to that commitment. This corresponds to the   justification   condition on knowledge. What is it that then corresponds to the third,   truth   condition on knowledge? For the scorekeeper to take the attributed claim to be true is just for the scorekeeper to endorse that claim. That is, the third condition is that the scorekeeper himself   undertake   the same commitment attributed to the candidate knower.  Undertaking a commitment is adopting a certain   normative stance   with respect to a claim; it is not attributing a property to it. The classical metaphysics of truth properties misconstrues what one is doing in endorsing the claim as   describing   in a special way. It confuses   attributing   and   undertaking   or   acknowledging   commit -  ments, the two fundamental social flavors of deontic practical atti -  tudes that institute normative statuses. It does so by assimilating the third condition on treating someone as having knowledge to the first two. Properly understanding truth talk in fact requires  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing   16 9  understanding just this difference of social perspective: between  attributing   a normative status to another and   undertaking   or adopting it oneself. 6   It is the practice of assessing the truth of claims that underlies the idea that propositional contents can be understood in terms of truth conditions. What I want to do is to show how this idea of   truth   claims as expressing differences in social perspective can be extended to representation more generally.  2 .   De dicto   and   De re  The prime explicitly representational locution of natural lan -  guages is   de re ascriptions of propositional attitudes.   It is their use in these locutions that make the words ‘of ’ and ‘about’ express the intentional directedness of thought and talk—their use in sen -  tences such as  “The time has come,” the walrus said ,  “To talk   of   many things :  Of   shoes—and ships—and sealing-wax —  Of   cabbages—and kings— ”  or  The hunter’s belief that there was a deer in front of her was actu -  ally a belief   about   a cow.  as distinct from their use in phrases such as “the pen of my aunt” and “weighing about five pounds.” Thus, in order to identify vocabulary in alien languages that means what ‘of ’ and ‘about’ used in this sense do, one must find expressions of   de re   ascriptions of propositional attitudes. It is these ascriptions that we use to   say  what we are talking and thinking   about.   My strategy here is to ad -  dress the question of how to understand what is expressed by rep -  resentational vocabulary by asking how expressions must be   used  in order to qualify as   de re   ascriptions of propositional attitudes.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  17 0   A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing  What do they make explicit? What are we   doing   when we talk and think about what we are talking and thinking   about?   This is a strategy for trying to understand intentionality generally, from a pragmatist point of view.  The tradition distinguishes two readings of or senses that can be associated with propositional attitude ascriptions. Ascriptions   de dicto   attribute belief in a   dictum   or saying, while ascriptions   de re  attribute belief about some   res   or thing. The distinction arises with sentential operators other than ‘believes’. Consider beginning with the claim:  The president of the United States will be black by the year  2020.  Read   de dicto,   this means that the dictum or sentence  The president of the United States is black.  will be true by the year   2020 . Read   de re,   it means that the   res   or thing, the present president of the United States (namely, as I write, Bill Clinton) will be black by the year   2020 . Our concern here is with how this distinction applies to ascriptions of proposi -  tional attitude—though it is a criterion of adequacy on the account offered here that it can be extended to deal with these other contexts as well. Clearly the difference has to do with   scope,   a way of expressing the difference between two different possible orders in which one can apply the operations of (a) determining who the definite description picks out, and (b) applying the tem -  poral operator to move the time of evaluation of the whole sen -  tence forward. Doing (a) first yields the   de re   reading, while doing  (b)   first yields the   de dicto   reading. I want to look a little deeper at the phenomenon.  In ordinary parlance the distinction between   de dicto   and   de re  readings is the source of systematic ambiguity. Sometimes, as in the case above, one of the readings involves a sufficiently implaus -  ible claim that it is easy to disambiguate. It is best, however, to  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing   17 1  regiment our usage slightly in order to mark the distinction ex -  plicitly. This can be done with little strain to our ears by using ‘that’ and ‘of ’ in a systematic way. Consider:  Henry Adams believed the inventor of the lightning rod did not  invent the lightning rod.  It is quite unlikely that what is intended is the   de dicto  Henry Adams believed   that   the inventor of the lightning rod  did not invent the lightning rod.  Adams would presumably not have endorsed the   dictum   that fol -  lows the ‘that’. It is entirely possible, however, that the   de re   claim  Henry Adams believed   of   the inventor of the lightning rod   that  he did not invent the lightning rod.  is true. For since the inventor of the lightning rod is the inventor of bifocals (namely, Benjamin Franklin), this latter claim could be true if Henry Adams had the belief that would be ascribed   de dicto   as  Henry Adams believed   that   the inventor of bifocals did not  invent the lightning rod.  (A proper Bostonian, loath to give such credit to someone from Philadelphia, Adams maintained that Franklin only popularized the lightning rod.)  Quine emphasizes that the key grammatical difference between these two sorts of ascriptions concerns the propriety of   substitu -  tion   for singular terms occurring in them. Expressions occurring in the   de re   portion of an ascription—within the scope of the ‘of ’ operator in the regimented versions—have in his terminology   ref -  erentially transparent   uses: coreferential terms can be intersubsti -  tuted   salva veritate,   that is, without changing the truth value of the whole ascription. By contrast, such substitution in the   de dicto  portion of an ascription—within the scope of the ‘that’ operator  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  17 2   A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing  in the regimented versions—may well change the truth value of the   whole   ascription.   Syntactically,   de   re   ascriptions   may   be thought of as formed from   de dicto   ones by   exporting   a singular term from within the ‘that’ clause, prefacing it with ‘of ’, and putting a pronoun in the original position. Thus the   de dicto   form  S   believes that   φ ( t )  becomes the   de re  S   believes   of   t   that   φ (it).  The significance of Quine’s fundamental observation that the key difference between these two sorts of ascription lies in the cir -  cumstances under which the substitution of coreferential expres -  sions is permitted was obscured by considerations that are from my point of view extraneous:  1 .   Quine’s idiosyncratic view that singular terms are dispensable in favor of the quantificational expressions he takes to be the genuine locus of referential commitment leads him to look only at quantified ascriptions, embroils his discussion in issues of existential commitment, and diverts him into worries about when ‘exportation’ is legitimate.  2 .   This emphasis led in turn (Kaplan bears considerable re -  sponsibility here) to ignoring the analysis of ordinary   de re  ascriptions in favor of what I call   epistemically strong de re  ascriptions, which are used to attribute a privileged epistemic relation to the object talked or thought about. This detour had fruitful consequences for our appreciation of special fea -  tures of the behavior of demonstratives (and, as a result, of proper name tokenings anaphorically dependent on them), particularly in modal contexts. But from the point of view of understanding aboutness in general—my topic here—it was a detour and a distraction nonetheless.  The important point is, as the regimentation reminds us, that it is   de re   propositional attitude-ascribing locutions that we use in  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing   17 3  everyday life to express what we are talking and thinking   of   or  about.   One way of trying to understand the representational dimension of propositional content is accordingly to ask what is expressed by this fundamental sort of representational locution. What are we   doing   when we make claims about what someone is talking or thinking   about?   How must vocabulary be used in order for it to deserve to count as expressing such   de re   ascriptions? Answering that question in a way that does not itself employ rep -  resentational vocabulary in specifying that use is then a way of coming to understand representational relations in nonrepresen -  tational terms.  3 .   Undertaking and Attributing  The rest of this chapter is about the expressive role of   de re   ascrip -  tions. I present it in the technical vocabulary I prefer, which is in some ways idiosyncratic; but the basic point about the way in which the use of this paradigmatic representational locution expresses differences in social perspective does not depend on the details of that idiom. 7  Recall that I think we should understand discursive practice in terms of the adoption of practical attitudes by which interlocutors keep score on one another’s commitments (and entitlements to those commitments, but we can ignore them here). Claiming (and so, ultimately, judging) is   undertaking   or   acknowledging   a commitment that is propositionally contentful in virtue of its  inferential   articulation. The large task is to show what it is about that inferential articulation in virtue of which claimable contents are therefore also   representational   contents. This is to move from propositional contents introduced as potential premises and con -  clusions of inferences, via the social dimension of inferential artic -  ulation that consists of giving and asking for reasons of one another in communication, to propositions as talking of or about objects and saying of them how they are. (I give short shrift here to the  objectivity   part of the claim—it is the topic of the next chapter—  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  17 4   A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing  but think about how assessments of   truth   were presented above as distinct from assessments of   belief   and   justification. )  Undertaking   a commitment is doing something that makes it appropriate for others to   attribute   it. This can happen in two dif -  ferent ways. First, one may   acknowledge   the commitment, para -  digmatically by being disposed to   avow   it by an overt assertion. Or one may acknowledge it by employing it as a premise in one’s the -  oretical or practical reasoning. This latter includes being disposed to   act   on it   practically —taking account of it as a premise in the practical reasoning that stands behind one’s intentional actions. Second, one may undertake the commitment   consequentially,   that is, as a conclusion one is committed to as an inferential conse -  quence entailed by what one   does   acknowledge. These correspond to two senses of ‘believe’ that are often not distinguished: the sense in which one believes only what one takes oneself to believe, and the sense in which one believes willy-nilly whatever one’s beliefs commit one to. (The fact that people often move back and forth between belief in the empirical sense, which does not involve inferential closure, and belief in the logical or ideal sense, which does, is one of the reasons why when being careful I prefer to talk in terms of commitments rather than beliefs. I do not officially believe in beliefs.) The second sense is the one in which if I believe Kant revered Hamann, and I believe Hamann was the Magus of the North, then whether the question has ever arisen for me or not, whether I know it or not, I in fact believe Kant revered the Magus of the North, for I have committed myself to that claim.  Attributing   beliefs or commitments is a practical attitude that is  implicit   in the scorekeeping practices within which alone anything can have the significance of a claim or a judgment.   Ascribing  beliefs or commitments is making that   implicit   practical attitude  explicit   in the form of a claim. In a language without explicit atti -  tude-ascribing locutions such as the ‘believes that’ or ‘claims that’ operator, attributing commitments is something one can only   do.  Propositional attitude-ascribing locutions make it possible explic -  itly to   say   that that is what one is doing: to express that practical  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing   17 5  deontic scorekeeping attitude as a propositional content, that is, as the content of a claim. In this form it can appear as a premise or conclusion of an inference; it becomes something which can be offered as a reason, and for which reasons can be demanded. The paradigm of the genus of   explicitating   vocabulary, of which propositional attitude-ascribing locutions are a species, is the con -  ditional. The use of conditionals makes explicit as the content of a claim, and so something one can   say,   the endorsement of an   infer -  ence —an attitude one could otherwise manifest only by what one  does.   Ascriptional vocabulary such as ‘believes’ or ‘claims’ makes  attribution   of doxastic commitments explicit in the form of claimable contents.  4 .   Ascribing  In asserting an ascriptional claim of the form  S   believes (or is committed to the claim) that   φ ( t ),  one is accordingly doing two things, adopting two different sorts of deontic attitude: one is   attributing   one doxastic commitment, to   φ ( t ), and one is   undertaking   another, namely, a commitment to the ascription. The explicitating role of ascriptional locutions means that the content of the commitment one   undertakes   is to be understood in terms of what one is doing in   attributing   the first commitment.  The ascription above specifies the content of the commitment attributed by using an unmodified ‘that’ clause, which according to our regimentation corresponds to an ascription   de dicto.   A full telling of my story requires that quite a bit be said about how these ascriptions work, but I am not going to do that here. Roughly, the ascriber who specifies the content of the attributed commitment in the   de dicto   way is committed to the target being prepared to   acknowledge   the attributed commitment in essentially the terms specified—that is, to endorse the   dictum. 8  I want to take an appropriate account of   de dicto   ascriptions of  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  17 6   A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing  propositional attitudes for granted and show what is different about   de re   ascriptions, those that are regimented in the form:  S   claims   of   t   that   φ (it).  I think that the beginning of wisdom in this area is the realization that (once what I have called ‘epistemically strong   de re   ascrip -  tions’ have been put to one side) the distinction between   de dicto  and   de re   should be understood to distinguish not two kinds of  belief   or belief-contents, but two kinds of   ascription —in particu -  lar, two different   styles   in which the   content   of the commitment ascribed can be   specified. 9   (Dennett is perhaps the most prominent commentator who has taken this line.) 10  In specifying the content of the claim that is attributed by an ascription, one finds that a question can arise as to who the ascriber takes to be responsible for this being a way of   saying   (that is, making explicit) what is believed—the content of the commit -  ment. Consider the sly prosecutor who characterizes his oppo -  nent’s claim by saying:  The defense attorney believes a pathological liar is a trustworthy  witness.  We can imagine that the defense attorney hotly contests this char -  acterization:  Not so; what I believe is that the man who just testified is a trust -  worthy witness.  To which the prosecutor might reply:  Exactly, and I have presented evidence that ought to convince  anyone that the man who just testified is a pathological liar.  If the prosecutor were being fastidious in characterizing the other’s claim, he would make it clear who is responsible for what: the defense attorney claims that a certain man is a trustworthy wit -  ness, and the prosecutor claims that that man is a pathological liar.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing   17 7  The disagreement is about whether this guy is a liar, not about whether liars make trustworthy witnesses. Using the regimenta -  tion suggested above, the way to make this explicit is with a   de re  specification of the content of the belief ascribed. What the prose -  cutor   ought   to say (matters of courtroom strategy aside) is:  The defense attorney claims   of   a pathological liar that he is a  trustworthy witness.  This way of putting things makes explicit the division of responsi -  bility involved in the ascription. That someone is a trustworthy witness is part of the commitment that is   attributed   by the ascriber, that that individual is in fact a pathological liar is part of the com -  mitment that is   undertaken   by the ascriber. (Think back to the account of the role of the truth condition in attributions of knowl -  edge.) Certainly in thinking about these matters,   we   as theorists should use such a disambiguating regimentation, in keeping with the analytic credo expressing commitments to faith, hope, and clarity (even if we are not sure that the greatest of these is clarity).  Ascription always involves attributing one doxastic commit -  ment and, since ascriptions are themselves claims or judgments, undertaking another. My suggestion is that the expressive func -  tion of   de re   ascriptions of propositional attitude is to make explicit which aspects of what is said express commitments that are being   attributed   and which express commitments that are   under -  taken.   The part of the content specification that appears within the   de dicto   ‘that’ clause is limited to what, according to the ascriber, the one to whom the commitment is ascribed would (or in a strong sense should)   acknowledge   as an expression of what that individual is committed to. The part of the content specifica -  tion that appears within the scope of the   de re   ‘of ’ includes what, according to the   ascriber   of the commitment (but not necessarily according to the one to whom it is ascribed), is acknowledged as an expression of what the target of the ascription is committed to. (This is what the target should, according to the ascriber,  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  17 8   A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing  acknowledge only in a much weaker sense of ‘should’.) Thus the marking of portions of the content specification of a propositional attitude ascription into   de dicto   and   de re   portions makes explicit the essential deontic scorekeeping distinction of   social   perspective between commitments attributed and those undertaken.  5 .   Substitutional Commitments  The difference expressed by segregating the content specification of a propositional attitude ascription into distinct   de re   and   de dicto   regions, marked in our regimentation by ‘of ’ and ‘that’, can be thought of in terms of   inferential   and   substitutional   commit -  ments. According to the model I started with, propositional, that is, assertible, contents are inferentially articulated. Grasping such a content is being able to distinguish in practice what should follow from endorsing it, and what such endorsement should follow from. But the consequences of endorsing a given claim depends on what other commitments are available to be employed as auxil -  iary hypotheses in the inference. The ascriber of a doxastic com -  mitment has two different perspectives available from which to draw those auxiliary hypotheses in specifying the content of the commitment being ascribed: that of the one to whom it is  ascribed   and that of the one   ascribing   it. Where the specification of the content depends only on auxiliary premises that (according to the ascriber) the target of the ascription   acknowledges   being com -  mitted to, though the ascriber may not, it is put in   de dicto   posi -  tion, within the ‘that’ clause. Where the specification of the content depends on auxiliary premises that the   ascriber   endorses, but the target of the ascription may not, it is put in   de re   position.  More particularly, the use of expressions as singular terms is governed by   substitution -inferential commitments. 11   The rule for determining the scorekeeping significance and so the expressive function of   de re   ascriptions that I am proposing is then the fol -  lowing. Suppose that according to   A ’s scorekeeping on commit-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing   17 9  ments,   B   acknowledges commitment to the claim   φ ( t ). Then   A  can make this attribution of commitment explicit in the form of a claim by saying:  B   claims   that   φ ( t ).  If in addition   A   acknowledges commitment to the identity   t = t   ′ ,  then whether or not   A   takes it that   B   would acknowledge that commitment,   A   can also characterize the content of the commit -  ment ascribed to   B   by saying:  B   claims   of   t   ′   that   φ (it).  Again, the question just is whose substitutional commitments one is permitted to appeal to in specifying the consequences someone is committed to by acknowledging a particular doxastic commit -  ment. Where in characterizing the commitment the ascriber has exfoliated those consequences employing only commitments the ascriptional target would acknowledge, the content specification is   de dicto.   Where the ascriber has employed substitutional com -  mitments he himself, but perhaps not the target, endorses, the content specification is   de re.  The question might then naturally be asked, are there locutions that perform the converse function, permitting one to   undertake  an   assertional   commitment, while   attributing   to another respon -  sibility for the use of the singular term that settles what   substitu -  tional   commitments are to be used in extracting its inferential consequences? I think this important expressive role is played by  scare quotes.   Suppose a politician says:  The patriotic freedom fighters liberated the village.  Disagreeing with the characterization, but wanting to stipulate that she is referring to the same folks, his opponent might respond:  Those “patriotic freedom fighters” massacred the entire popula -  tion.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  18 0   A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing  Saying this is attributing responsibility for use of the term, while undertaking responsibility for the claim. I do not see why the ex -  pressive role of scare quotes is not every bit as philosophically sig -  nificant as that of   de re   ascriptions, though the relative mass of the literature devoted to these two topics suggests that this is an idio -  syncratic view.  Understood in the way I have suggested, what is expressed by  de re   specifications of the contents of the beliefs of others is crucial to   communication.   Being able to understand what others are saying, in the sense that makes their remarks available for use as premises in one’s own inferences, depends precisely on being able to specify those contents in   de re,   and not merely   de dicto,   terms. If the only way I can specify the content of the shaman’s belief is by a  de dicto   ascription:  He believes malaria can be prevented by drinking the liquor dis -  tilled from the bark of that kind of tree,  I may not be in a position to assess the truth of his claim. It is oth -  erwise if I can specify that content in the   de re   ascription  He believes of quinine that malaria can be prevented by drink -  ing it,  for ‘quinine’ is a term with rich inferential connections to others I know how to employ. If he says that the seventh god has just risen, I may not know what to make of his remark. Clearly he will take it to have consequences that I could not endorse, so nothing in my mouth could   mean   just what his remark does. But if I am told that the seventh god is the sun, then I can specify the content of his report in a more useful form:  He claims of the sun that it has just risen,  which I can extract   information   from, that is, can use to gener -  ate premises that I can reason with. Again, suppose a student claims:  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing   18 1  The largest number that is not the sum of the squares of distinct  primes is the sum of at most twenty-seven primes.  He may have no idea what that number is, or may falsely believe it to be extremely large, but if I know that  17,16 3   is the largest number that is not the sum of the squares of  distinct primes,  then I can characterize the content of his claim in   de re   form as:  The student claims   of   17,16 3   that it is the sum of at most twenty -  seven primes,  and can go on to draw inferences from that claim, to assess its plausibility in the light of the rest of my beliefs. (It is true, but only because   all   integers are the sum of at most twenty-seven primes.) Identifying what is being talked about permits me to extract infor -  mation across a doxastic gap.  We saw originally in the treatment of truth assessments and knowledge the crucial difference between   attributing   a commit -  ment and   undertaking   or acknowledging one. We now see what is involved in moving from the claim  It is true that Benjamin Franklin invented bifocals,  which is the undertaking of a commitment to the effect that Ben -  jamin Franklin invented bifocals, via the undertaking of a commit -  ment to the claim that Benjamin Franklin is the inventor of the lightning rod, to the claim  It is true   of   the inventor of the lightning rod that he invented  bifocals.  (It is through this ‘true of ’ locution that the earlier remarks about the essentially social structure of truth assessments connects with the account just offered of the social structure that underlies propositional attitude ascriptions   de re. ) Extracting information  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  18 2   A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing  from the remarks of others requires grasping what is expressed when one offers   de re   characterizations of the contents of their beliefs—that is, to be able to tell what their beliefs would be true  of   if they were true. It is to grasp the   representational   content of their claims. The point I have been making is that doing this is just mastering the   social   dimension of their inferential articulation.  If we look at   de re   specifications of the content of   intentions,   we will see that the prediction or explanation of   success   of actions plays a role here similar to that of the assessment of   truth   in the case of  beliefs.   So we can have the   de dicto   ascription of an intention:  Nicole intends that she shoot a deer.  together with the   de re   ascription of a belief:  Nicole believes of that cow that it is a deer.  yielding the   de re   ascription of an intention:  Nicole intends of that cow that she shoot it.  We would appeal to these perspectivally different sorts of specifi -  cations of the content of her intention in order to explain different aspects of her behavior. If what we want to do is to predict or explain what Nicole is   trying   to do, we should use the   de dicto  specification of her intention and her belief. That will explain why she will pull the trigger. But if what we want to predict or explain is what she will   succeed   in doing, what will actually happen, then we should use the   de re   specifications. They will explain why she will shoot a cow, even though she wants only to shoot deer. Suc -  cess of actions plays the same role as truth of claims, as far as con -  cerns the difference between   de re   and   de dicto   specifications of the contents of intentional attitudes.  III.   Conclusion  I have claimed that the primary representational locution in ordi -  nary language, the one we use to talk about the representationa l  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing   18 3  dimension of our thought and talk, to specify what we are think -  ing and talking   about,   is   de re   ascriptions of propositional attitude. It is the role they play in such ascriptions that gives their meanings to the ‘of ’ or ‘about’ we use to express intentional directedness. I have also claimed that the expressive role of these locutions is to make explicit the distinction of social perspective involved in keeping our books straight on who is committed to what. The social dimension of inference involved in the communication to others of claims that must be available as reasons both to the speaker and to the audience, in spite of differences in collateral commitments, is what underlies the representational dimension of discourse.  Beliefs and claims that are   propositionally   contentful are neces -  sarily   representationally   contentful because their inferential ar -  ticulation   essentially   involves   a   social   dimension.   That   social dimension is unavoidable because the inferential significance of a claim, the appropriate antecedents and consequences of a doxastic commitment, depends on the background of collateral commit -  ments available for service as auxiliary hypotheses. Thus any speci -  fication   of   a   propositional   content   must   be   made   from   the perspective of some such set of commitments. One wants to say that the   correct   inferential role is determined by the collateral claims that are   true.   Just so; that is what   each   interlocutor wants to say: each has an at least slightly different perspective from which to   evaluate   inferential   proprieties.   Representational   locutions make explicit the sorting of commitments into those attributed and those undertaken—without which communication would be impossible, given those differences of perspective. The   representa -  tional   dimension of propositional contents reflects the   social  structure of their   inferential   articulation in the game of giving and asking for reasons.

Semantic Assertibilism  A basic pragmatist methodological thesis is that the point of the theoretical association of   meanings   with linguistic expressions is to explain the   use   of those expressions. (Semantics must answer to pragmatics.) A fundamental divide among theorists who agree in endorsing this methodological pragmatism then concerns the terms in which the use of linguistic expressions is understood. One camp takes as its explanatory target   proprieties   of use. Mean -  ings are invoked to explain how it is   correct   or   appropriate   to use words and sentences, how one   ought   to deploy them. The other camp (Quinean behaviorists may serve as an example) insists on specifying the use to be explained in sparer terms. The ultimate explanatory target at which semantic theory aims is utterances and dispositions to utter described in a vocabulary resolutely restricted to nonnormative terms. 1   I will say something further along about why I think the second camp is misguided. But for now I just want to put this option to one side, with the observation that doing so does not by itself require relinquishing commitments to naturalis -  tic semantics. For one might well accept a normative characteriza -  tion of the explanatory target—specifying use in terms that permit one to distinguish, say, correct from incorrect representations of  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  18 6   Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality  states of affairs—while retaining a commitment eventually to offering a reductive account of the origin and nature of those pro -  prieties in turn, framed in the sort of modally rich but not explic -  itly normative vocabularies routinely employed in the special sciences, whether physical, biological, or social. 2  The idea behind assertibility theories of the propositional con -  tents expressed by declarative sentences is to start with a notion of linguistic propriety that could be understood in terms of allowable moves in a game. To specify the circumstances in which a sentence is assertible is to say when its assertional use is appropriate or allowable, when a speaker is licensed or entitled to use the sen -  tence to perform that speech act, when its assertional utterance would have a certain sort of normative significance or status. Bas -  ing one’s semantics on the association of sentences with asserti -  bility conditions is not only a way of construing meaning as potentially explanatory of use. It is also an identification of mean -  ing with a core feature of use—one, presumably, in terms of which other important dimensions of use can then be explained. The very tight connection that is envisaged between meaning, so con -  strued, and proprieties of use is, I think, one of the sources of the attractiveness of broadly assertibilist approaches to meaning.  Another is the prospect of starting with relatively clear explana -  tory raw materials. The first obligation of the assertibility theorist will of course be to explain the notion of assertibility. Doing that requires first saying something about assertional force: about what it is for a speech act to have the significance of an assertion. The next requirement is to specify a sense of propriety appropriate to that speech act: to say what it is for an assertion to be appropriate or correct, for the speaker to be entitled or permitted to produce it. Neither of these tasks is simple or straightforward. But we do have a relatively familiar and unmysterious framework in which to address them. For the first takes its place as an instance of distin -  guishing different kinds of moves in a game; we are invited to think of asserting as a species in the same genus with punting, bid-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality   18 7  ding, castling, betting, and so on. And the second takes its place as an instance of saying when moves of the specified kind are permit -  ted. We should count ourselves fortunate indeed if we could, as the assertibilist hopes and promises, construct a workable concept of the meaning or content associated with declarative sentences (and hence also with the beliefs and judgments they express) from such raw materials.  The biggest challenge to this happy prospect stems from the fact that assertions are subject to two essential but fundamentally different kinds of normative appraisal. We can ask whether an assertion is correct in the sense that the speaker was entitled to make it, perhaps in virtue of having reasons, evidence, or some other sort of justification for it. This might be thought of as a way of asking whether the speaker is blameworthy for performing this speech act, whether the speaker has fulfilled the obligations the rules of the game specify as preconditions for making a move of this sort in the game. This is the normative aspect of use the assertibilist begins with. But we can also ask whether the assertion is correct in the sense of being   true,   in the sense that things are as it claims they are. It is a basic criterion of adequacy of a seman -  tic theory that it explain this dimension of normative assessment, this normatively described aspect of use. The challenge to the sort of approach to semantics I have been calling ‘assertibilist’ is to show how the conceptual raw materials this approach allows itself can be deployed so as to underwrite attributions of propositional content for which this sort of   objective   normative assessment is intelligible.  The attempt by assertibility theorists to satisfy this central crite -  rion of adequacy of semantic theories has typically taken the form of appeals to some sort of   ideality   condition. Assessments of truth are understood as assessments of assertibility under ideal condi -  tions (what Sellars called ‘semantic assertibility’)—of what claims one would be entitled to or justified in making if one were an ideal knower, or given full information, maximal evidence, at the end of  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  18 8   Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality  inquiry, and so on. I’m not going to argue the point here, but my own view is that this sort of strategy is hopeless. 3   If it is the best available, we should just give up the assertibilist project. In that case the obvious alternative is to start with a notion of mean -  ing that directly underwrites normative assessments of objective representational correctness: truth conditions. We will not then be able to explain the association with linguistic expressions of semantic contents, so understood, by straightforward assimila -  tion to making moves allowed by the rules defining a game, as promised by the alternative broadly assertibilist explanatory strat -  egy. Attempts by truth-conditional semantic theorists to construct the other dimension of normative assessment of assertions—as -  sertibility in the sense of entitlement, justification, having reasons or evidence—have typically taken the form of reliability theories. Assessments of assertibility in the sense of cognitive entitlement or justification are understood as assessments of objective or subjec -  tive likelihood of truth. In Chapter   3   I rehearsed some of the structural problems afflicting this sort of strategy as well.  What I want to do instead is to explore a different way in which one might start from the sort of normative statuses the assertibilist invokes, intelligible in terms of moves in a rule-governed game, and on that basis associate with declarative sentences proposi -  tional contents that are objective in the sense of swinging free of the attitudes of the linguistic practitioners who deploy them in assertions. The idea is roughly to split up the notion of assertibility into two parts. More precisely, where assertibility theorists appeal to just   one   sort of normative status—a sentence being assertible, or a speaker being justified or having sufficient reasons to assert it—I look at   two   kinds of normative status: commitment and enti -  tlement. Discerning this additional normative structure in linguis -  tic practice, in particular, exploiting the relations and interactions between these two kinds of normative status articulating the   force  or significance of linguistic performances, makes possible the specification of propositional   contents   with desirable properties.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality   18 9  Chief among these is the   objectivity,   in the sense of a specifiable sort of attitude-transcendence, of the propositional contents that are suitably defined in terms of the roles played by their bearers in linguistic practices characterized in terms of alterations and inher -  itance of commitments and entitlements. This result holds good even if the normative statuses of commitment and entitlement are themselves understood as   social   statuses, that is, as creatures of individual and communal attitudes.  II.   Giving and Asking for Reasons  Semantic assertibilism is implicitly committed to demarcating specifically   linguistic   practices by restricting that term to practices that confer on some performances the significance of   claims   or  assertions.   What is assert ed   in an act of assert ing,   what is assert ible,  is a propositional content. Assertible contents, assertibles, are also believables and judgeables; states of belief and acts of judgment can accordingly be expressed by assertions. Linguistic expressions whose freestanding utterances have the default significance of assertions are (declarative) sentences. My aim is to investigate the propositional contents that are associated with linguistic expres -  sions by their playing this central role in assertional practices.  The first key idea is that a performance deserves to count as hav -  ing the significance of an assertion only in the context of a set of social practices with the structure of (in Sellars’s phrase) a   game of giving and asking for reasons.   Assertions are essentially perfor -  mances that can both serve as and stand in need of reasons. Propositional contents are essentially what can serve as both premises and conclusions of inferences. This inferentialist idea might be called ‘linguistic rationalism’. 4   Linguistic rationalism is not a standard part of the armamentarium of semantic assertibil -  ism, but I think it is what is required to make that explanatory strategy work. I suggested in Chapter   1   what seem to me good reasons to see giving and asking for reasons as the defining core of  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  19 0   Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality  discursive (concept-mongering) practice; I do not propose to rehearse them here. Rather, I want to treat linguistic rationalism as a hypothesis, and to explore its consequences.  In the rest of this chapter I make two arguments. First, in this section I argue that no set of practices is recognizable as a game of giving and asking for reasons for assertions unless it involves acknowledging at least two sorts of normative status,   commit -  ments   and   entitlements,   and some general structures relating them. I show how we can understand practices incorporating those statuses in that structure as conferring propositional con -  tents on linguistic expressions suitably caught up in them. Then, in the next section, I argue that propositional contents specified in terms of their contribution to the commitments and entitlements that articulate the normative significance of speech acts exhibiting those contents display   objectivity   of a particular sort: they are not about any constellation of attitudes on the part of the linguistic practitioners who produce and consume them as reasons.  Suppose we have a set of counters or markers such that produc -  ing or playing one has the social significance of making an asser -  tional move in the game. We can call such counters ‘sentences’. Then for any player at any time there must be a way of partition -  ing sentences into two classes, by distinguishing somehow those that he is disposed or otherwise prepared to assert (perhaps when suitably prompted). These counters, which are distinguished by bearing the player’s mark, being on his list, or being kept in his box, constitute his score. By playing a new counter, making an assertion, one alters one’s own score, and perhaps that of others.  Here is my first claim: for such a game or set of toy practices to be recognizable as involving assertions, it must be the case that playing one counter, or otherwise adding it to one’s score, can  commit   one to playing others, or adding them to one’s score. If one asserts, “The swatch is red,” one   ought   to add to one’s score also “The swatch is colored.” Making the one move   obliges   one to be prepared to make the other as well. This is not to say that all  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality   19 1  players actually   do   have the dispositions they   ought   to have. One may not act as one is committed or obliged to act; one can break or fail to follow this sort of rule of the game, at least in particular cases, without thereby being expelled from the company of play -  ers of the asserting game. Still, I claim, assertional games must have rules of this sort: rules of   consequential commitment.  Why? Because to be recognizable as assertional, a move must not be idle, it must make a difference, it must have consequences for what else it is appropriate to do, according to the rules of the game. Assertions express judgments or beliefs. Putting a sentence on one’s list of judgments, putting it in one’s belief box, has con -  sequences for how one ought, rationally, to act, judge, and believe. We may be able to construct cases where it is intelligible to attribute beliefs that are consequentially inert and isolated from their fellows: “I just believe that cows look goofy, that’s all. Noth -  ing follows from that, and I am not obliged to act in any particular way on that belief.” But   all   of our beliefs could not intelligibly be understood to be like this. If putting sentences onto my list or into my box   never   has consequences for what else belongs there, then we ought not to understand the list as consisting of all my judgments, or the box as containing all my beliefs. For in that case knowing what moves someone was disposed to make would tell us nothing else about that person.  Understanding a claim, the significance of an assertional move, requires understanding at least some of its consequences, know -  ing what else (what other moves) one would be committing one -  self to by making that claim. A parrot, we can imagine, can produce   an   utterance   perceptually   indistinguishable   from   an assertion of “The swatch is red.” Our nonetheless not taking it to have asserted that sentence, not to have made a move in that game,   is   our taking it that, unaware as it is of the inferential involvements of the claim that it would be expressing, of what it would be committing itself to were it to make the claim, it has not thereby succeeded in committing itself to anything. Making that  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  19 2   Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality  assertion is committing oneself to such consequences as that the swatch is colored, that it is not green, and so on.  For this reason we can understand making a claim as taking up a particular sort of normative stance toward an inferentially ar -  ticulated content. It is   endorsing   it, taking   responsibility   for it,  committing   oneself to it. The difference between treating some -  thing as a claiming and treating it just as a brute sounding-off, between treating it as making a move in the assertional game and treating it as an idle performance, is just whether one treats it as the undertaking of a commitment that is suitably articulated by its consequential relations to other commitments. These are   ratio -  nal   relations, whereby undertaking one commitment   rationally  obliges one to undertake others, related to it as its inferential con -  sequences. These relations articulate the   content   of the commit -  ment or responsibility one undertakes by asserting a sentence. Apart from such relations, there is no such content, hence no assertion.  I have been belaboring what is perhaps an obvious point. Not just any way of distinguishing some sentences from others can be understood as distinguishing those asserted, those that express judgments or beliefs from the rest. For putting a sentence on a list or in a box to be intelligible as asserting or believing it, doing so must at least have the significance of committing or obliging one to make other moves of a similar sort, with sentences that (thereby) count as inferentially related to the original. Absent such consequential commitments, the game lacks the rational structure required for us to understand its moves as the making of contentful assertions.  The next claim I want to make is that practices incorporating a game of giving and asking for reasons— rational   practices, which linguistic rationalism supposes to be the only ones that deserve to be thought of as   linguistic   practices—must involve acknowledg -  ment of a   second   kind of normative status. We have said that mak -  ing a move in the assertional game should be understood as  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality   19 3  acknowledging a certain sort of   commitment,   articulated by con -  sequential inferential relations linking the asserted sentence to other sentences. But players of the game of giving and asking for reasons must also distinguish among the commitments an interlocutor undertakes, a distinguished subclass to which she is  entitled.   Linguistic rationalism understands assertions, the funda -  mental sort of speech act, as essentially things that can both serve as and stand in need of reasons. Giving reasons for a claim is pro -  ducing other assertions that   license   or   entitle   one to it, that   justify  it. Asking for reasons for a claim is asking for its warrant, for what entitles one to that commitment. Such a practice presupposes a distinction between assertional commitments to which one is entitled and those to which one is not entitled. Reason-giving practices make sense only if there can be an issue as to whether or not practitioners are entitled to their commitments.  Indeed, I take it that liability to demands for justification—that is, demonstration of entitlement—is another major dimension of the responsibility one undertakes, the commitment one makes, in asserting something. In making an assertion one implicitly acknowledges the propriety, at least under some circumstances, of demands for reasons, for justification of the claim one has en -  dorsed, the commitment one has undertaken. Besides the   com -  mittive   dimension of assertional practice, there is the   critical  dimension: the aspect of the practice in which the propriety of those commitments is assessed. Apart from this critical dimension, the notion of   reasons   gets no grip.  So the overall claim is that the sense of endorsement that deter -  mines the force of assertional speech acts involves, at a minimum, a kind of   commitment   the speaker’s   entitlement   to which is always potentially at issue. The assertible contents expressed by declara -  tive sentences whose utterance can have this sort of force must accordingly be inferentially articulated along both normative dimensions. Downstream, they must have inferential   consequences,  commitment to which is entailed by commitment to the original  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  19 4   Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality  content. Upstream, they must have inferential   antecedents,   rela -  tions to contents that can serve as premises from which entitle -  ment to the original content can be inherited.  These two flavors of normative status are not simply indepen -  dent of each other. They interact. For the entitlements at issue are entitlements to commitments. We can say that two assertible con -  tents are   incompatible   in case   commitment   to one precludes   enti -  tlement   to the other. Thus commitment to the content expressed by the sentence “The swatch is red” rules out entitlement to the commitment that would be undertaken by asserting the sentence “The swatch is green.” Incompatibilities among the   contents  expressed by sentences, derived from the interaction of the two normative dimensions articulating the   force   of assertions of those sentences, induce their own sort of inferential relation. For we can associate with each sentence the set of all the sentences that are incompatible with it, according to the rules of the particular asser -  tional game of giving and asking for reasons within which it plays a role. Inclusion relations among these sets then correspond to inferential relations among the sentences. That is, the content of the claim expressed by asserting “The swatch is vermilion” entails the content of the claim expressed by asserting “The swatch is red,” because everything incompatible with being red is incom -  patible with being vermilion. 5  So the two sorts of normative status that must be in play in practices that incorporate a game of giving and asking for reasons, commitment and entitlement, induce   three   sorts of inferential relations in the assertible contents expressed by sentences suitably caught up in those practices:  committive   (that is, commitment-preserving) inferences, a cate -  gory that generalizes deductive inference;  permissive   (that is, entitlement-preserving) inferences, a cate -  gory that generalizes inductive inference; and  incompatibility   entailments, a category that generalizes modal (counterfactual-supporting) inference.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality   19 5  It can be argued on relatively general grounds, though I will not do so here, that these three sorts of inferential consequence relation can be ranked strictly by their strength: all incompati -  bility entailments are commitment-preserving (though not vice versa), and all commitment-preserving inferences are entitlement -  preserving (though not vice versa).  This is what in the title of the chapter I call “the normative fine structure of rationality.” Rational practices, practices that include the production and consumption of reasons—the “giving and asking for reasons” of the Sellarsian slogan with which we began— must distinguish two sorts of normative status: a kind of   commit -  ment,   undertaken by the assertional speech acts by which alone anything can be put forward   as   a reason, and a kind of   entitlement,  which is what is at issue when a reason is requested or required. This normative fine structure is   inferentially articulated   along three axes, defined by inheritance of commitment, inheritance of entitlement, and entailments according to the incompatibilities defined by the interactions of commitments and entitlements.  The core idea behind assertibility theories was a pragmatist one. It is to start with something we   do   —specifically, to start with the fundamental speech act of   assertion,   with the notion of assertional  force —and to read off a notion of   content   (what we say or think) directly from proprieties governing that sort of speech act. Thus the content expressed by declarative sentences was to be identified and articulated in terms of assertibility conditions, that is, condi -  tions under which it would be   appropriate   to assert the sentence. I have suggested that in the context of a commitment to linguistic rationalism, to the idea that the game of giving and asking for rea -  sons is the home language game of assertion, this undifferentiated normative notion of the propriety of an assertion can be replaced by a more finely articulated normative structure. For the game of giving and asking for reasons reveals itself as involving two differ -  ent sorts of normative status (and so normative assessment). The score we must keep on those who engage in practices that include giving and asking for reasons has two components: we must keep  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  19 6   Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality  track of what they are   committed   to, and also of which of these commitments they are   entitled   to.  Making this refinement at the level of the   pragmatic   theory, the theory of assertional   force,   induces corresponding refinements at the level of   semantic   theory, the theory of assertible   content.   For now instead of the undifferentiated question “Under what cir -  cumstances would it be appropriate to assert the sentence?” we must ask, “Under what circumstances (for instance, in the context of what other claims) would one count as   committed   to the claim expressed by the sentence?” and “Under what circumstances (for instance, in the context of what other claims) would one count as  entitled   to the claim?” Indeed, it appears that we should look not only upstream, by asking what claims or circumstances commit or entitle us to the claim in question, but also downstream, by asking to what else the claim in question commits or entitles us as   conse -  quences.   Further, we should take account of the interaction of these two normative dimensions into which we have subdivided the undifferentiated notion of assertibility or appropriate asser -  tion by asking also with what other claims the claim in question is  incompatible.   This structure gives broadly assertibilist semantic theories—those that seek to derive a notion of semantic content directly from the proprieties of use that are the subject matter in the first instance of pragmatics—a great deal more to work with.  III.   Objectivity  What I want to do in this final section is to demonstrate one of the semantic payoffs that this richer pragmatic structure enables.  Assertibilist semantic theories seek to understand propositional content by associating with sentences as their semantic interpre -  tants   assertibility conditions:   circumstances under which the sen -  tence in question is appropriately assertible. The attraction of such theories is due to the very close tie they establish between meaning and use. They hold out the promise of reading   semantic   norms  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality   19 7  directly off of   pragmatic   ones, that is, off of the rules for the assert -  ing game, or the norms implicitly acknowledged by those who par -  ticipate in assertional practice. The challenge for them is to get out the other end of their machinery a sense of ‘correct’ that is suffi -  ciently objective to be recognizable as a notion of propositional content. On the face of it, assertional speech acts are subject to two central sorts of normative appraisal. One asks whether the speech act was appropriate in light of the attitudes of the practitioners: Was all available evidence taken into account? Were the inferences made good ones, as far as the practitioners know? In general, did the speaker follow the rules of the game, so as not to be blamewor -  thy for producing the assertion? The other sort of appraisal swings free of the attitudes of the practitioners and looks instead to the subject matter about which claims are made for the applicable norms. Here the central question is: Is the claim correct in the sense that things really are as it says they are? Only an omniscient being could follow a rule enjoining practitioners to make only claims that are true. This means that the conduct of those who, through no fault of their own, make false claims is not blamewor -  thy. Nonetheless, this further sort of appraisal is possible.  So theories of this sort face a structural dilemma. In order to make their raw materials as intelligible as possible, one wants to tie assertibility closely to people’s attitudes, to what they   take   to be assertible or   treat as   assertible. This need not take the extreme form of identifying the assertibility conditions of sentences with nonnormatively specified conditions under which practitioners are disposed to assert those sentences. But there is pressure to make whatever norms are invoked be ones that can be read off of the attitudes of practitioners who apply and acknowledge the applicability of those norms. Yet the more closely the norms of assertibility that articulate the contents associated with sentences reflect the attitudes of those who use the sentences, the farther they will be from the sort of objective norms appealed to in assess -  ments of representational correctness, of getting things right  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  19 8   Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality  according to a standard set by the things about which one is speaking. If ‘assertible’ is read as requiring correctness in this more objective sense, then assertibility conditions just become truth conditions, and the link to the attitudes and practices of those who use the sentences to make claims, which promised to make the association of sentences with semantic content intelli -  gible, becomes correspondingly obscured. So the challenge for assertibility theories is to start with a notion of propriety of asser -  tion that is grounded in and intelligible in terms of the practice of speakers and audiences, and yet which is rich enough to fund nor -  mative assessments that are objective in the sense of transcending the attitudes of practitioners.  Consider an example of the sort that standardly causes trouble for assertibility theories. Whenever  1 .   “The swatch is red”  is appropriately assertible, it is equally appropriate to assert  2 .   “The claim that the swatch is red is properly assertible by me now.”  For the latter just makes explicit, as part of the content that is assert ed,   what it is implicit in what one is doing in the former assert ing.   And yet we want to say that the contents are different. Though the two claims have the same   assertibility   conditions, they have different   truth   conditions. For the swatch could   be   red with -  out my being in a position to   say   that it is. And surely we could describe circumstances in which I would have extremely good evi -  dence that the swatch was red, so that ( 1 ) is assertible for me, even though it in fact was not red—perhaps even in circumstances where the swatch does not exist. It seems that assertibility theories are leaving out something important.  But things look different if we help ourselves to the finer -  grained normative vocabulary of commitment and entitlement, and hence of incompatibility. We see that ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) would be incompatibility-equivalent (in the sense that they incompatibility-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality   19 9  entail each other) just in case everything incompatible with ( 1 ) were incompatible with ( 2 ), and vice versa. But in the situations just described, this is precisely not so. To say that the swatch could be red without my being in a position to say that it is, is to say that some claims are incompatible with ( 1 ) being assertible by me now that are not incompatible with ( 1 ). For instance,  3 .   “I do not exist,” or  4 .   “Rational beings never evolved”  are both incompatible with ( 2 ) but not with ( 1 ). And to say that there are circumstances in which I would have extremely good evidence that ( 1 ) is true, so that it is appropriately assertible by me, even though ( 1 ) is not in fact true, is just to say there are claims that are incompatible with ( 1 ), but not with its being assertible by me. But  5 .   “In the absence of a swatch, but otherwise in circumstances that are perceptually quite standard, my optic nerve is being stimulated just as it would be if there were a red swatch in front of me”  might   qualify.   The   additional   normative   expressive   resources made available by distinguishing the status of being assertionally  committed   from that of being   entitled   to such a commitment are sufficient to distinguish the contents of ordinary claims from those of claims about what is assertible.  One might worry that this result is not robust, but depends on setting up the test case in terms of the undifferentiated notion of appropriate assertibility, while assessing it using the more specific normative notions of commitment and entitlement (and so in -  compatibility). This thought suggests that better test cases would be provided by  2 ′ . “I am now committed to the claim that the swatch is red,” and  2 ″ . “I am now entitled to the claim that the swatch is red.”  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  20 0   Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality  But in fact this additional specificity makes no difference. ( 3 ) and  ( 4 )   are incompatible with both ( 2 ′ ) and ( 2 ″ ), just as they were with ( 2 ), though not incompatible with ( 1 ). And ( 5 ), or some variant of it, is still incompatible with ( 1 ), but not with ( 2 ′ ) or ( 2 ″ ).  In fact, looking at ( 2 ′ ) and ( 2 ″ ) offers some insight into   why  distinguishing the normative statuses of commitment and en -  titlement offers an important expressive advance in broadly as -  sertibilist semantic theories, when compared with the vaguer notion of assertibility. For although one is   committed   to ( 2 ′ ) whenever one is   committed   to ( 1 ), one is not   entitled   to those claims in all the same circumstances. In particular, I can be   enti -  tled   to ( 2 ′ ) just on the basis of a rehearsal of my commitments, per -  haps by noticing that I just asserted ( 1 ), without needing to investigate the colors of swatches. But I can become   entitled   to ( 1 ) only by an investigation of just that sort. In the other case it is not at all clear even that one is   entitled   to ( 2 ″ ) whenever one is entitled to ( 1 ). Insofar as reliabilism is correct (what I called the Founding Insight of reliabilism in Chapter   3 ), I can   be   entitled to claims without having good reason to   believe   that I am so entitled. But even if that is wrong, and entitlements to claims of the form of ( 2 ″ ) do go along with entitlements to base-level claims such as ( 1 ), the two sorts of claims are still distinguishable in terms of the   commit -  ments   they involve. For surely one could be   committed   to the claim that the swatch is red, that is, to ( 1 ), without thereby being committed to the claim that one is   entitled   to it. In general, one  ought   to be entitled to one’s commitments, but the game of giving and asking for reasons has a point precisely insofar as we must distinguish between commitments to which one is entitled and those to which one is not. So one must at least allow that it is   possible   that one is in such a situation in any particular case. Again, ( 2 ″ ) and ( 1 ) do not evidently have the same commitment -  inferential   consequences.   The condtional  6 .   “If the swatch is red, then the swatch is red”  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality   20 1  is evidently correct in that it codifies a commitment-preserving inference. (The stuttering inference is as safe as any could be.) By contrast, the conditional  7 .   “If I am entitled to the claim that the swatch is red, then the swatch is red”  is not one that ought to be endorsed as correct in the sense of commitment-preserving, at least for any notion of entitlement that humans can secure regarding empirical matters of fact. It is, after all, an instance of the very implausible schema  8 .   “If   S   is entitled to the claim that the swatch is red, then the swatch is red.”  Now, I have been careful to be as noncommittal as possible regarding the specifics of the notions of commitment and entitle -  ment (and hence incompatibility) employed in discussing these examples. For that reason, some of my particular claims about what are and are not good inferences, in any of the three funda -  mental senses of the permissive, committive, or incompatibility entailments, will be controversial for those who have in mind some particular ways of thinking about commitment and (espe -  cially) entitlement. But worries about these details will not affect the overall point I am after. For that is that notions of commit -  ment and entitlement (and hence of incompatibility)   can   be put in play so as rigorously and systematically to distinguish between the contents of ordinary empirical claims and the contents of any claims about who is committed or entitled to what. The fact that other ways of deploying the notions of commitment and entitle -  ment would   not   allow all of those distinctions is neither here nor there; it would just provide a good reason not to use   those   notions of commitment and entitlement.  The fact is that the distinction between sentences sharing  assertibility   conditions and sharing   truth   conditions, illustrated, for instance, by sentences such as  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  20 2   Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality  9 .   “I will write a book about Hegel,” and  10 .   “I foresee that I will write a book about Hegel,”  which are alike in the first way but not in the second, can be made out in terms of commitments and entitlements, without the need to invoke the notion of truth. I may be   committed   to ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) in the same circumstances, and may even be   entitled   to them in the same circumstances; we could regiment the use of ‘foresee’ so as to ensure this. But  11 .   “I will die in the next ten minutes”  will still be incompatible with ( 9 ) and not with ( 10 ), for any notion of foreseeing that does not entail omniscience. 6   And we should not be surprised by this result. For the   consequences   of ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) are quite different.  12 .   “If I will write a book about Hegel, then I will write a book about Hegel”  is, once again, as secure an inference as one could wish.  13 .   “If I foresee that I will write a book about Hegel, then I will write a book about Hegel,”  by contrast, is a conditional whose plausibility depends on how good I am at foreseeing. (There are lots of orphaned “Volume I”s about, after all.) Even though the commitment made explicit in the antecedent of ( 13 )   is   the commitment expressed in the conse -  quent, there are claims, such as ( 11 ), that are incompatible with its consequent and not incompatible with its antecedent. The differ -  ence in content between ( 9 ) and ( 10 ), which we are accustomed to think of as a difference in truth conditions (compatible with the identity of their assertibility conditions), just is the difference in their consequences, encapsulated in the different status of the conditionals ( 12 ) and ( 13 ). And that difference manifests itself in a difference in the claims that are incompatible with ( 9 ) and ( 10 ), a  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality   20 3  notion we can understand entirely in terms of the normative sta -  tuses of commitment and entitlement. Put another way, looking at propositional content in terms of incompatibilities, themselves defined in terms of the fundamental normative statuses of com -  mitment and entitlement, provides the expressive resources to dis -  tinguish between the sense of ‘assertible’ that falls short of guaranteeing truth (as ‘foresee’ does), and the sense (perennially sought in terms of some sort of ‘ideal’ entitlement, in a sense of ‘ideal’ that removes it substantially from actual practices of giving and asking for reasons) that would guarantee truth. This is the sense of “It is assertible that . . .” that would be redundant, in that the incompatibilities associated with “It is assertible that   p ” would be just those associated with   p   as they are for “It is   true   that   p .”  The point of all this is that the   objectivity   of propositional con -  tent—the fact that in claiming that the swatch is red we are not saying anything about who could appropriately assert anything, or about who is committed or entitled to what, are indeed saying something that could be true even if there had never been rational beings—is a feature we can make intelligible as a structure of the commitments and entitlements that articulate the use of sen -  tences: of the norms, in a broad sense, that govern the practice of asserting, the game of giving and asking for reasons. And we can make sense of practices having that structure even if we under -  stand commitment and entitlement as themselves   social   statuses, instituted by the attitudes of linguistic practitioners.   All   that is required is that the commitments and entitlements they associate with ordinary empirical claims such as “The swatch is red” gener -  ate incompatibilities for these claims that differ suitably from those associated with any claims about who is committed to, enti -  tled to, or in a position to assert anything. The recognition of propositional contents that are objective in this sense is open to any community whose inferentially articulated practices acknowl -  edge the different normative statuses of commitment and entitle -  ment. I argued in the previous section that this includes all  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆  20 4   Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality  rational   communities—all of those whose practices include the game of giving and asking for reasons. According to the thesis of linguistic rationalism, this is all linguistic communities whatso -  ever. I have tried here to explain how we can begin to understand the objectivity of our thought—the way in which the contents of our thought go beyond the attitudes of endorsement or entitle -  ment we have toward those contents—as a particular aspect of the normative fine structure of rationality. 7  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆   ◆   ◆  Note s  Introduction  1 .

There are, of course, many   causal   intermediaries, since the noninferential observation report is a propositionally contentful commitment the acknowledg -  ment of which stands at the end of a whole causal chain of reliably covarying events, including a cascade of neurophysiological ones. But I do not see that any of these has any particular conceptual or (therefore) cognitive or semantic significance. The strongest argu -  ments to the contrary, from the point of view presented in this work, are those presented by my colleague John McDowell in   Mind and World   (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press,   1994 ). Wilfrid Sellars,   Action, Knowledge, and Reality,   ed. H. N. Castaneda (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill,   1975 ), p.   285 . I tell such a story in more detail in the first three chapters of   Making It Explicit   (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press,   1994 ). Sellars’s seminal inferentialist tract “Inference and Meaning,” in  Pure Pragmatism and Possible Worlds: The Early Essays of Wilfrid Sellars,   ed. J. Sich (Reseda Calif.: Ridgeview Publishing,   1980 ), pp.   257 – 286 , does not make these distinctions. Accordingly it may be subject to the criticism that it assembles evidence for weak inferen -  tialism, and then treats it as justifying a commitment to strong infer -  entialism, or even hyperinferentialism.

As a quick gesture at the sort of thing I have in mind, consider  adverbs.   A verb such as ‘walks’ can be assigned a function from objects to sets of possible worlds as its semantic interpretant. Then an adverb such as ‘slowly’ can be assigned a function from [functions from objects to sets of possible worlds] to [functions from objects to  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n15 .  16 .  17 .  18 .  ◆  Notes to Pages   35–4 2   20 7  sets of possible worlds]. It is then a straightforward matter to repre -  sent the semantic difference between attributive and nonattributive adverbs: the difference between adverbs such as ‘slowly’, where the inference from ‘a Fs’ to ‘a Fs slowly’ is a good one, and adverbs such as ‘in one’s imagination’, where the corresponding inference is not a good one. See, for example, David Lewis’s “General Semantics,” in  Semantics of Natural Language,   ed. G. Harman and D. Davidson (Dordrecht: Reidel,   1972 ), pp.   169 – 218 . Cf. chap.   3   of Charles Taylor’s   Hegel   (New York: Cambridge Univer -  sity Press,   1975 ). Hegel is not always read as addressing the topics I see as central to his work—primarily regarding the nature of conceptual norms and conceptual content. But when he is so read, he turns out to have a great deal of interest to say. Developing and justifying this interpre -  tive line is a major undertaking. I foresee that I will write a book about Hegel. Versions of some of these lectures have been published in other places. An early rendering of Chapter   1   appeared as “Inference, Ex -  pression, and Induction: Sellarsian Themes,”   Philosophical Studies   5 4  ( 1988 ):   257 – 285 .

Chapter   3   was published in   Monist   81 , no.   3   (July   1998 ):  371 – 392 ,   Reunifying Epistemology.   The general line of thought devel -  ops themes from the first half of Chapter   4   of   Making It Explicit.  Chapter   4   presents the central argument of Chapter   6   of   Making It Explicit.   A version of Chapter   5   was published as “Reasoning and Representing,” in Michaelis Michael and John O’Leary-Hawthorne, eds.,   Philosophy in Mind: The Place of Philosophy in the Study of Mind  (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers,   1994 ), pp.   159 – 178 . It and Chapter   6   both develop themes from Chapter   8   of   Making It Explicit.

First, the “deleterious effects in logic” Dummett has in mind include taking logics to be individuated by their theorems rather than their consequence rela -  tions. Although one can do things either way for classical logic, in more interesting cases logics can have the same theorems but differ -  ent consequence relations. Second, the contrast with   analytic   is not obviously   contingent:   why rule out the possibility of necessity that is not conceptual, but, say, physical? Third, the closing claim seems his -  torically wrong. Kant already distinguished analytic from synthetic judgments, and his concerns did not evidently stem from concern with the subject matter of logic. I include the passage anyway, since I think the shift in emphasis Dummett is endorsing is a good one, although the reasons he advances need filling in and cleaning up.  4 .

Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism  1 .   The expectation or prediction need not rise to the level of perfect  certainty.   Although there may well be a use of ‘knows’ that requires such certainty, it was one of the great advances in twentieth-century epistemology prior to the advent of reliabilism to realize that such a concept of knowledge not only includes an unrefusable invitation to skepticism, but also is of no use for discussing the achievements of science, and in any case is not obligatory. If our ordinary use of ‘know’ involves such commitments, that is the best possible reason to replace it by a less committive technical notion that is more useful for our central epistemological purposes. The fact that there are circumstances in which we would have been wrong should not preclude our counting as knowing in the cases where we are in fact right. Our fallibility should not be taken to rule out the possibility of knowledge.  2 .   According to this line of thought, one can know something without knowing that one knows. (The K p   →   KK p   principle fails.) One might believe that   p   without believing that one knows that   p.   For, as in the example of the potsherds, one may not even believe that the belief is the outcome of a reliable process, though it is. The attitude of the believer might be that the belief she finds herself with perceptually just happened in this case to be true. Since belief is a condition for knowledge, if one does not even   believe   that one knows that   p,   then one does not   know   that one knows it.

For the stronger require -  ment would limit knowledge to beliefs acquired inferentially. But we ought to be able to allow that   non inferentially acquired beliefs—for instance, those acquired perceptually (and, arguably, by memory or even testimony)—can constitute genuine knowledge. The require -  ment would just be that after the fact the believer can offer reasons for her belief, for instance, by invoking her own reliability as a nonin -  ferential reporter. It is tempting to overgeneralize from this platitude (in much the same way as it is from the Founding Insight of reliabilism) by seeking to   define   first the   truth   (and then in turn the   truth conditions ) of be -  liefs in terms of conduciveness to success of actions based on those beliefs. There are insuperable objections to such an explanatory strat -  egy, which I have discussed in “Unsuccessful Semantics,”   Analysis   54 , no.   3   (July   1994 ):   175 – 178 . This is Sellars’s strategy for defending justificatory internalism, in “Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind.” See the discussion of this point in my study guide to Wilfrid Sellars,   Empiricism and the Philos -  ophy of Mind,   (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press,   1997 ). “Having reasons” rather than “being able to give reasons,” because justificatory internalism need not be committed to withholding attri -  butions of knowledge in cases where the possessor of reasons (in the form of other justified beliefs from which the belief in question fol -  lows) is de facto unable to produce them, say, through having for -  gotten them. For a more nuanced discussion, see my treatment of Sellars’s account of the logic of ‘looks’, in the study guide to   Empiricism and the Phi -  losophy of Mind.  Semantic programs such as those of Dretske, Fodor, and Millikan are at their weakest when addressing the question of what distinguishes representations that deserve to be called ‘beliefs’ from other sorts of indicating states.

Strictly, what is referred to by a singular term is a particular. Not all particulars are   objects:   there are also events, processes, and so on. The present argument does not turn on the differences among these sorts of particulars, and it will often be more convenient simply to talk of objects, where in fact any sort of particular can be involved.  2 .

In a sense, of course, we do not know how many such sentences there are, even restricting ourselves to a basic vocabulary, since we do  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n6 .  7 .  8 .  9 .  10 .  11 .  12 .  ◆  Notes to Pages   127–13 1   21 3  not have a syntactically adequate grammar for any natural language. But there are grammars that will generate   only   sentences of English. The difficult thing is getting one that will generate   all   of them, with -  out generating all sorts of garbage as well. For instance, Donald Davidson emphasizes this point in his influen -  tial “Theories of Meaning and Learnable Languages,” reprinted in Donald Davidson,   Inquiries into Truth and Interpretation   (Oxford: Clarendon Press,   1984 ), pp.   3 – 16 . Notice that the problem of projection such a strategy addresses concerns moving from   proprieties   governing the use of one set of sentences to proprieties governing the use of a superset. A quite dif -  ferent issue concerns the relation between the correct use even of the sentences in the initial subset, on the one hand, and the actual occa -  sions of use or dispositions of the community to use them. These puzzles must be sharply separated, for the first remains within the normative dimension, asking after the relation between two different sets of practically embodied norms, while the second asks after the relation between such norms and the nonnormative happenings that express them. Roughly the direction taken in my   Making It Explicit   (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press,   1994 ). Type/token issues are suppressed for the purposes of this chapter. This requirement is not absolute. My “Singular Terms and Sentential Sign Designs,”   Philosophical Topics   15 , no.   1   (Spring   1987 ):   125 – 16 7  (referred to hereafter as “STSSD”), shows how to make do just with substitutional relations among substituted-in expressions and how to do without antecedently distinguishable substituted-for expressions. Strictly speaking, this is true only of what Dummett calls ‘complex’ predicates, by contrast to ‘simple’ ones, about which more later in this chapter. But as Dummett points out in making the distinction, Frege “tacitly assimilated simple predicates to complex ones.” Michael Dummett,   Frege’s Philosophy of Language   (New York: Harper and Row,   1973 ), p.   30 . From Frege’s mature point of view, this qualification does not need to be made: sentences   are   singular terms, and the frames   are   predicates.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n21 4  13 .  ◆   Note to Page   13 2  This is what motivates Frege’s classification of sentences as singular terms. As will be pointed out later in this chapter, this need not be the whole story about sentences, a fact that immunizes Frege some -  what from Dummett’s scandalized response to this point. Qua sub -  sentential expressions, sentences are singular terms; the thesis is innocent of the objectionable implications Dummett complains about (missing the special role of sentences as usable to make moves in the language game—as though Frege had no idea of force, and as though being a name of the True or the False did not play a very spe -  cial role for him) because sentences are not   essentially   subsentential expressions, and it is not as subsentential expressions that they have their special pragmatic position. (I am grateful to John McDowell for pointing this out.) This point is distinct from, although related to, the distinction Dum -  mett makes, in chap.   2   of   Frege’s Philosophy of Language,   between simple and complex predicates. Dummett there points out (follow -  ing Geach’s discussion in “Quine on Classes and Properties” ( Philo -  sophical Review   6 2   [ 1953 ]:   409 – 412 ) that there is no simple   part   or subexpression common to “Rousseau admired Rousseau” and “Kant admired Kant” that is not also a part of “Kant admired Rousseau.” Yet the first two share with each other a complex predicate that they do not share with the third. One of Frege’s great discoveries was that one must be able to discern predicates in this sense (complex, or sub -  stitutionally derived ones) in order to appreciate the inferential role of sentences like “Anyone who admires someone admires himself.” For one must appreciate the different patterns they instantiate in order to see that in the context of that quantificational claim, “Kant admired Rousseau” entails “Kant admired Kant.” Thus the status of predicates as playing derived substitution-structural roles is what lies behind the second of Strawson’s stigmata distinguishing predicates from singular terms: that they are subject to quantification. Concern with quantification, in particular with codifying the inferential role of quantificational claims, enforces the distinction between simple and complex predicates, between expressions that can be substituted for and those that are substitutional frames. But the need for this dis-  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n14 .  15 .  16 .  ◆  Notes to Pages   135–13 6   21 5  tinction is not, as Dummett claims ( Frege’s Philosophy of Language,  pp.   28 ,   30 ), simply a consequence of the presence of quantificational locutions in a language. Complex predicates must be discerned by anyone who has mastered the sort of pattern of inference that is typically   made   explicit   by   a   quantificational   expression   such   as ( x )( y )[ Rxy   →   Rxx ]. Such inferential connections can be important already in a language even though quantifiers have not yet been introduced to codify them explicitly as the contents of claims. Non -  trivial work must be done (and “STSSD” shows that it can be done, and how), to turn the notion of predicate as equivalence class of sub -  stitutionally variant sentences, defined here, into the full-blooded notion of a cross-referenced predicate, as will be required for the introduction of quantifiers. It should not be thought that all goodnesses of inference must con -  form to the preservation model, in that there is a kind of status such that the inference is good if the conclusion has the same status as the premises (any more than it should be thought that all good infer -  ences have some sort of substitutional goodness). The notion of ‘transmission’ of status is intended to indicate that the possession of a certain status by the premise (for instance, that   S   is assertionally com -  mitted to it) guarantees or provides the reason for the possession of that status by the conclusion. The remarks in the text apply to com -  mitment-preserving inferences (the genus of which deductive infer -  ences are a species), but it should be noted that they need not apply to   entitlement -preserving inferences (the genus of which inductive inferences are a species). I am grateful to Ernest LePore for pointing this out. The restriction to substitution inferences is required because one may, for instance, infer asymmetrically from the applicability of a sin -  gular term to the applicability of a predicate: from “The inventor of bifocals is Benjamin Franklin” to “The inventor of bifocals is an American.” These do not count as substitution inferences even in the extended sense allowing replacement of frames, because they cross syntactic categorical boundaries. Sortals, such as ‘dog’ and ‘mammal’, might seem to contradict this  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n21 6  17 .  18 .  19 .  20 .  ◆   Notes to Pages   137–14 7  claim. For they are distinguished from predicates precisely in having associated with them not only criteria of application but also criteria of identity, and yet they can be materially involved in weakening inferences: “Thera is a dog, so Thera is a mammal.” But their criteria of identity apply not to substitutions materially involving the sortals themselves, but to those materially involving the singular terms to which the sortals are applied. What is at issue here is an inferentialist version of the distinction between extensional and nonextensional (or transparent and opaque) occurrences of, typically, singular terms. It need not be denied that occurrences whose significance is not gov -  erned in this way are semantically significant in a secondary sense, which can be explained only once the primary sense is understood. This is discussed further along. These examples can only represent the asymmetries at the level of sentences. Singular terms   do not   behave asymmetrically, so real exam -  ples of asymmetrically behaving substituted-fors are not forthcom -  ing. Probably the closest one can get in real grammar is sortals. Since they have associated with them criteria of identity for the singular terms they qualify, they are more termlike than predicates. Yet they do have proper inclusions, and a straightforward notion of inferential weakening applies to them, as to predicates. The objection may now occur that these examples show that expressions such as predicates, whose occurrences   do   have asymmetric significances,   can   occur embedded in inferentially inverting contexts, showing that some -  thing must be wrong in the analogous argument to the conclusion that substituted-for expressions must have symmetric substitution -  inferential significances. This legitimate worry is addressed further along, where the distinction between basic subsentential expressions, which can be substituted for, and derived subsentential expression patterns (frames of derived substitutional category), which can only be replaced (as outermost, hence never embedded), will be invoked. Recall that to take it that   q   is incompatible with   p   is to take it that commitment to   q   precludes entitlement to a commitment to   p.   In this way acknowledgments of material incompatibilities are implicit  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n21 .  22 .  23 .  24 .  ◆  Notes to Pages   149–15 5   21 7  in the practices governing adopting attitudes (for instance, undertak -  ing or attributing) toward the same pragmatic statuses of commit -  ment   and   entitlement   that   inferences   can   be   distinguished   as preserving. Indeed, it could be argued that possession of this reflexive expressive capacity and all that goes with it makes so much difference that it provides a plausible place to draw the line between the linguistic and the nonlinguistic. The line between logical and prelogical languages is in any case important enough that researchers investigating what sorts of languages chimps and dolphins can be taught would be well advised to postpone trying to teach them an extra two hundred terms and predicates and instead try to teach them to use condition -  als and quantifiers. But there are important cases where it seems to be worth paying the expressive price for dropping logical sentence -  compounding devices. In conversation my colleague Ken Manders suggested the language of projective geometry as an example in this connection. Sometimes ‘general points’ are appealed to, whose pro -  jective properties form a proper subset of the projective properties of other points and so are asymmetrically inferentially related to one another in the way sortals can be: particular points have all the prop -  erties of general points but not vice versa. How is this possible? Pro -  jective properties are not closed under Boolean operations such as complementation, and one cannot introduce conditional proper -  ties—a restriction that has sometimes been seen as puzzling. The present argument explains the unobvious connection between the introduction of general points and the exclusion of negation and the conditional from the language in which projective properties are specified. Notice that this characterization of the conclusion could be accepted even by someone who was not persuaded by the expressive approach to understanding the demarcation of specifically logical vocabulary and so the function of logic. Or the singular terms can be individuated by the transformations. This is the route taken in “STSSD.”  Tractatus   5 . 62 .

There are a myriad technical details that need to be cleared up in order to make an analysis of truth talk along these lines work. I have addressed those difficulties elsewhere: that is where the prosentential or anaphoric account of truth comes in. See Chapter   5   of   Making It Explicit,   and “Pragmatism, Phenomenalism, and Truth Talk,”   Mid -  west Studies in Philosophy   1 2   ( 1988 ):   75 – 93 ,   Realism.

The approach pursued here (including a treatment of both   de dicto  ascriptions and epistemically strong   de re   ascriptions) is presented at length in Chapter   8   of   Making It Explicit.  8 .   Obviously, such an account requires emendation to handle the cases where the one to whom a propositional attitude is ascribed would use indexicals, or a different language, to express that attitude. See Chapter   8   of   Making It Explicit.  9 .   One way to see that this is right is that the ascription-forming opera -  tors can be   iterated: S   ′   can claim of   t   that   S   claims of it that   φ (it).

It might be noticed in passing that it is   not   harmless to paraphrase this choice as that between talking about how linguistic expressions  ought   to be used, and how they are   actually   or   in fact   used, or how practitioners are   disposed   to use them. Using an expression correctly or incorrectly is something practitioners can actually or in fact do, something they can be disposed to do. The difference should be located rather in the vocabulary the theorist is permitted to use in characterizing what speakers and audiences actually do and are dis -  posed to do. Formulating this difference as a difference between say -  ing how the language   is   used and how it (only)   ought   to be used is the decisive move in the conjuring trick that lands one in the intractable puzzlements about conceptual normativity that Kripke’s Wittgenstein has made familiar.  2 .   I think of Dretske, Fodor, and Millikan as presenting theories with this general shape. Perhaps Gibbard’s very different approach to moral norms, when generalized and adapted to the case of linguistic norms, will find its place here too.  3 .   My thought is that there is no way to specify the ideality in question that is not either question-begging (in implicitly appealing to a notion of truth) or trivial, in the light of the sensitivity of the practi -  cal effects of otherwise more ideal status for one belief both to the  falsity   of collateral beliefs and (even more damaging) to   ignorance  concerning them. I present one argument along these lines in “Unsuccessful Semantics”   Analysis   54 , no.   3   (July   1994 ):   175 – 178 .  4 .   It is not identical with inferentialism as introduced in Chapter   1 , since that thesis concerned the relative explanatory priority of the concepts of inference and representation, and linguistic rationalism as used here is silent about representation. In   Making It Explicit   (Cam -  bridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press,   1994 ) [hereafter   MIE   ], I distinguish three sorts of inferentialist claims: weak inferentialism, strong inferentialism, and hyperinferentialism. Weak inferentialism is the claim that inferential articulation is a   necessary   aspect of con -  ceptual content. Strong inferentialism is the claim that   broadly   in -  ferential articulation is   sufficient   to determine conceptual content  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n22 0  5 .  6 .  ◆   Notes to Pages   194–20 2  (including its representational dimension). Hyperinferentialism is the claim that   narrowly   inferential articulation is   sufficient   to deter -  mine conceptual content. Broadly inferential articulation includes as inferential   the   relation   even   between   circumstances   and   conse -  quences of application, even when one or the other is   non inferential (as with observable and immediately practical concepts), since in applying any concept one implicitly endorses the propriety of the inference from its circumstances to its consequences of application. Narrowly inferential articulation is restricted to what Sellars calls “language-language” moves, that is, to the relation between propo -  sitional contents. Weak inferentialism is the most plausible of these theses. Strong inferentialism is the view endorsed and defended here and in   MIE.   (It is sometimes thought that in his classical inferentialist tract “Inference and Meaning” of   1948 , Sellars presents an argument for weak inferentialism but draws strong inferentialist conclusions.) Hyperinferentialism is plausible at most for some abstract mathemat -  ical concepts. Linguistic rationalism is a version of weak inferential -  ism, which the present chapter endeavors to show has some strong inferentialist consequences, when suitably elaborated. It should be remarked that acknowledging incompatibilities means treating the assessment of entitlements as a two-stage process. First, one assesses prima facie claims to entitlement, and then one winnows from this set those commitments that are incompatible with other commitments, and hence precluded from entitlement. What I call (here and in what follows) “entitlement-preserving inferences” struc -  ture the inheritance of prima facie commitments. As Crispin Wright has pointed out (in an unpublished comment on this argument), according to the definitions offered here, if two claims differ in their incompatibilities, they can at most be alike in the circumstances in which one is prima facie entitled to them, not in the circumstances in which one is   finally   entitled to them. The assert -  ibilist tradition did not make this distinction, since it did not divide the undifferentiated status of assertibility into commitment and enti -  tlement in the first place (and hence was not in a position to discuss incompatibility). I think a good case can be made for treating the bits  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n7 .  ◆  Note to Page   20 4   22 1  of their motivations that (implicitly) concern entitlement as address -  ing prima facie entitlements. A fuller telling of this story (such as that in   Making It Explicit ) would distinguish   three   moves beyond classical assertibility theories in order to fund a suitable notion of objective representational content for declarative sentences. The first is the move from treating assertibility as the fundamental normative pragmatic or force-related notion to commitment and entitlement (which then makes it possible to define incompatibility). The second is the move from the   circumstances  under which the normative status in question is acquired (assertibil -  ity conditions) to include also   consequences   of acquiring it, as urged in Chapter   1 . This is moving toward a notion of content as inferential role, identifying propositional contentfulness as suitability to play the role both of conclusion and of premise in inferences of various sorts. The interaction of this move with the previous one generates the three notions of inference (commitment-preserving, entitlement -  preserving, and incompatibility entailments) employed in the text. The third is the move from looking at normative   statuses   (assertibil -  ity, commitment, entitlement) to normative   social attitudes.   This is to focus on   attributing   (to others) and   acknowledging   (oneself ) commitments and so on as the primary phenomenon. In Chapter   5   I argued that this distinction of   social perspective   is what makes intelli -  gible the specifically   representational   dimension of propositional contents. One might have worried, at the end of that story, about how it is possible (what one has to do in order) to adopt, as it were, a third-person perspective toward one’s   own   attitudes, and so take them to be subject in principle to the same sort of assessment to which one subjects the attitudes of others, in offering   de re   specifica -  tions of their contents. The argument of this chapter provides the answer to that question.  Copyright © 2000 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\n\n◆   ◆   ◆  Inde x  Aboutness,   42 ,   158 .

However, the expansive necessity of these terms forced them beyond their boundaries—a Part cannot exist without the context it implies.

The Whole is not merely the sum of the Parts, but the active force that retroactively determines what the Parts mean. In this final synthesis, the linear timeline of reading is sublated. The End (the Whole) is recognized as having been the driving cause of the Beginning (the Parts). The contradiction between the plurality of axioms and the unity of the argument is resolved in the Concrete Universal, where diversity is the very form of unity.",

        "summary": "This introductory section establishes the strategic landscape for 'Articulating Reasons'. Brandom defines his project as an investigation into the nature of the 'conceptual', distinguished sharply from mere 'sentience' or non-discursive complexity. The core thesis—Inferentialism—is immediately posited: conceptual content is constituted by its role in reasoning, reversing the traditional order which prioritizes reference (representation) over inference. The text outlines a methodological commitment to 'Differentiation' (focusing on the discontinuity between sapient and non-sapient creatures) and 'Pragmatism' (explaining conceptual content in terms of the practice of using concepts), explicitly rejecting 'Assimilation' and 'Platonism'.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic begins by isolating 'The Conceptual' as a unique domain of 'Sapience'. Rather than viewing the mind as a passive mirror (Platonism/Representationalism) or merely a complex biological feedback loop (Assimilation), the text positions the conceptual as a distinctively 'Normative' space of reasons. The movement is from the 'Implicit' doing of non-discursive creatures to the 'Explicit' reasoning of sapient beings. Brandom argues that we must first understand the *activity* (Pragmatism) of inference to derive the *objectivity* of content, effectively sublating the static notion of 'meaning' into the dynamic notion of 'use'.",
        "interpretive_notes": "The text abruptly cuts off during the definition of Platonism, but the trajectory is clear: Platonism (content explains use) is the thesis to be inverted by Pragmatism (use explains content). This inversion is the foundational move of the book's logic."

He outlines two fundamental methodological choices governing his project: 1) 'Differentiation' over 'Assimilation', asserting a sharp discontinuity between the normative activity of concept-users (sapience) and the causal behavior of non-discursive creatures (sentience); and 2) 'Pragmatism' over 'Platonism', prioritizing the study of concept-use (practice) to explain conceptual content, rather than assuming content exists prior to its use.",

Where classical views might posit 'representation' or 'meaning' as the foundation of mind, this framework posits 'inference' as the primitive. This is the move to Inferentialism. To achieve this, the text performs a 'Pragmatic Turn': we do not start with Platonist entities (meanings) and ask how we grasp them; we start with the messy, subjective practice of doing things (reasoning) and show how objective conceptual content emerges from it. Furthermore, the text rejects the naturalistic urge to smooth over the difference between humans and animals. Instead, it highlights 'Sapience' as a unique normative status—a discontinuity where the rules of logic and reason emerge not from biology, but from the social game of giving and asking for reasons.",

Sentience is treated as a biological/causal state (s), while Sapience is treated as a normative status (n).

He establishes a hierarchy where inference is privileged over reference, and the normative practice of reasoning explains semantic content. He explicitly distinguishes 'sapience' (concept use) from mere 'sentience' (sensory awareness), identifying the former with participation in discursive practices. Furthermore, he situates his methodology within two binary oppositions: he chooses 'differentiation' (emphasizing the discontinuity between concept-users and non-users) over 'assimilation', and 'pragmatism' (explaining content via practice) over 'platonism' (explaining practice via pre-existing content).",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The text initiates a dialectical movement away from the static, mirror-like view of the mind (Platonism/Representationalism) toward a dynamic, activity-based view (Pragmatism/Inferentialism). The 'Conceptual' is not treated as an abstract realm of forms, but as a specific mode of doing—specifically, the doing of 'reasoning.' Brandom performs a compressive move by isolating 'sapience' from the broader biological category of 'sentience.' This separation allows for a rigorous analysis of what makes human understanding unique: the ability to justify claims. The narrative arc begins by grounding the objective stability of concepts in the subjective instability of social practices, positing that the 'what' (content) is generated by the 'how' (process).",
        "interpretive_notes": "Brandom's distinction between 'assimilation' and 'differentiation' is crucial. By choosing differentiation, he avoids the reductionism of evolutionary continuity arguments (common in naturalism) to focus on the normative rupture that language introduces. This sets the stage for a logic that is deontic (about rules/oughts) rather than merely causal."

It defines the 'conceptual' not as a static mental property, but as a dynamic role in reasoning (sapience). Brandom positions his methodology through two binary oppositions: differentiation over assimilation (emphasizing the discontinuity between human discursive practice and animal sentience) and pragmatism over platonism (explaining conceptual content in terms of normative use, rather than assuming content to explain use).",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The investigation begins by isolating the concept of 'the conceptual' itself. Rather than viewing the mind as a passive mirror of nature (a view later associated with representationalism), the text posits that 'awareness' in the relevant sense—sapience—is an achievement of activity. This activity is 'inference.' \n\nThe argument immediately bifurcates the philosophical history. On one side lies 'Assimilation' (treating thoughts like complex biological reactions) and 'Platonism' (treating meaning as an abstract entity existing before we use it). Brandom sublates these by insisting on 'Differentiation' and 'Pragmatism.' We are not merely clever animals; we are normative creatures binding ourselves to rules of inference. Furthermore, meaning is not a gift found in a Platonic realm; it is a status conferred by the rigorous social practice of giving and asking for reasons. Thus, the arrow of explanation is reversed: we do not start with reference to build inference; we start with the practice of inference to earn the right to reference.",

While he keeps the focus on 'practice' (pragmatism), he rejects the 'assimilation' of linguistic norms to biological habits. This suggests a 'Rationalist Pragmatism'—practice is primary, but it is a distinctively rational, discontinuous type of practice."

        "summary": "In this opening segment, Robert Brandom establishes the strategic parameters for 'Articulating Reasons'. He introduces the project as an investigation into the nature of the 'conceptual', distinguished sharply from mere 'sentience' or non-discursive awareness. The text outlines a fundamental inversion of traditional semantic explanation: rather than treating 'inference' (reasoning) as a process built upon stable 'references' (naming), Brandom argues for 'Inferentialism'—the view that conceptual content is constituted by its role in reasoning. Furthermore, he explicitly commits to 'Conceptual Pragmatism', asserting that the objective content of concepts must be explained in terms of the subjective practice of applying them, rejecting 'Platonist' views where content exists prior to use. This sets the stage for a philosophy of mind that prioritizes the normative activity of 'sapience' (understanding) over the causal mechanisms of biological 'sentience'.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic begins by severing the continuity between the animal and the human, or more precisely, between the 'sentient' and the 'sapient'. Brandom posits a 'discontinuity' theory: to be a concept-user is not merely to be a complex information processor, but to enter a distinct normative space. \n\nTwo major compressive moves define this starting point. First, the 'Pragmatist' move: the static 'content' of a concept is collapsed into the dynamic 'practice' of its use. Meaning is no longer a thing found, but a deed done. Second, the 'Inferentialist' move: the vertical relationship of 'reference' (word-to-world) is subordinated to the horizontal relationship of 'inference' (claim-to-claim). The stability of the objective world is thus framed not as a premise of the system, but as a result to be achieved through the rigor of discursive norms.",
        "interpretive_notes": "Brandom uses binary oppositions (Assimilation vs. Differentiation, Platonism vs. Pragmatism) to map his position. Note the explicit rejection of 'assimilationist' strategies (typical of naturalism), suggesting that the logic of sapience requires a distinct deontic operator—'normative status'—that cannot be reduced to physical description."

Brandom articulates a reversal of the traditional order of semantic explanation: rather than starting with 'reference' (word-to-world relations) to explain 'inference' (word-to-word relations), he argues that conceptual content is fundamentally constituted by its role in reasoning. He distinguishes 'Sapience' (conceptual awareness) from mere 'Sentience' (perceptual awareness), committing to a methodology of 'Differentiation' that emphasizes the discontinuity between discursive users of concepts and non-discursive animals. Finally, he pits 'Pragmatism' against 'Platonism', asserting that the correct direction of explanation flows from the practice of using concepts (doing) to the understanding of conceptual content (meaning).",

In the traditional view (Representationalism), the mind mirrors the world, and logic merely shuffles these mirrors. Brandom negates this, positing that 'Sapience'—the specific capacity for understanding—is a normative status achieved through participation in the game of giving and asking for reasons. \n\nThis move requires a sharp 'Differentiation' between the biological substrate (Sentience) and the logical superstructure (Sapience). The text subverts the 'Assimilationist' tendency to view mind as merely complex biology, instead framing the conceptual as a distinct normative space. Furthermore, the text establishes 'Pragmatism' as the engine of this logic: abstract Meanings (Content) are not discovered platonic entities but are the compressive result of concrete social Practices (Use). Thus, the Objective (content) is shown to be sustained by the Necessities of the Subjective (practice).",

He explicitly defines the scope as an investigation into the nature of the conceptual, specifically prioritizing 'inference' over 'reference' in the order of explanation. This marks a shift from a representational paradigm to an inferentialist one. Brandom outlines two fundamental strategic choices governing his approach: 1) A commitment to 'Differentiation', emphasizing the discontinuity between the sapient (concept-using) and the merely sentient (non-concept-using), rather than assimilating them into a continuous naturalistic hierarchy. 2) A commitment to 'Pragmatism' over 'Platonism', meaning that the possession of conceptual content is to be explained by the practical activity of using concepts, rather than explaining use by appeal to antecedent, abstract contents.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The text begins by clearing the ground for a new structure of rationality. The Subject (the philosophical inquirer) steps back to map the strategic terrain. Two paths diverge immediately. The first choice concerns the relation of Mind to Nature. The text rejects the path of 'Assimilation', which seeks to smooth over the gap between the causal reactions of a beast and the judgments of a knower. Instead, it chooses 'Differentiation', positing a sharp rupture where the Normative emerges from the Causal—a move from mere sentience to sapience. \n\nThe second choice concerns the relation of Meaning to Doing. The text rejects 'Platonism', which views meaning as a static treasure to be grasped. Instead, it posits 'Pragmatism': meaning is a residue of doing. The Concept is not a mirror reflecting the world; it is a tool forged in the fires of social practice. Here, the 'Prior' (abstract content) is sublated by the 'Posterior' (concrete practice), revealing that the theoretical is necessarily an expression of the practical. This sets the stage for the primary thesis: that to understand the world (Reference), one must first understand the game of reasons (Inference).",
        "interpretive_notes": "Brandom is establishing the 'boundary conditions' of his system. The rejection of Platonism is a rejection of semantic foundationalism. The rejection of Assimilation is a rejection of reductive naturalism. This sets up a 'normative turn' where logic is not a reflection of metaphysical laws, but the articulation of social propriety."

Brandom defines his project as a fundamental inversion of the traditional order of semantic explanation. Rather than beginning with reference (representation) or truth as primitive atoms of meaning, he advocates for 'Inferentialism': understanding conceptual content primarily through its role in reasoning. He situates this approach within a specific philosophical topography defined by two major binary oppositions. First, he distinguishes his view from 'Assimilationist' accounts, emphasizing the discontinuity between the 'sapience' of concept-users and the mere 'sentience' of non-discursive creatures. Second, he aligns himself with 'Conceptual Pragmatism' over 'Platonism', asserting that the objective content of concepts must be explained in terms of the subjective practice of applying them, rather than treating practice as the mere employment of antecedent contents.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The text initiates a move from a passive, 'Platonist' conception of mind—where the subject merely grasps pre-existing abstract contents—to an active, 'Pragmatist' conception where content is generated through 'doing'. This is the birth of the *Normative Turn* in this specific text. Brandom explicitly subordinates the objective world-relation (Reference) to the social deontic practice (Inference). By privileging 'discontinuity', he sets up a barrier against reducing the mind to biology; Sapience is not just more complex Sentience, but a different kind of logical space entirely—the space of reasons. This establishes the trajectory of the book: to recover the stability of objective representation (the world) *out of* the fluid dynamics of social reasoning.",
        "interpretive_notes": "Brandom's 'Pragmatism' here is specifically semantic (functionalist), distinct from the Jamesian notion of truth-as-utility. It is a structural claim about the priority of *act* over *object*."

Brandom immediately inverts the traditional order of semantic explanation. Instead of treating 'representation' (mirroring the world) as the foundation of meaning, he argues that the content of concepts is derived from their use in reasoning. He distinguishes his approach through two primary methodological choices: 'Differentiation' (emphasizing the discontinuity between sapient concept-users and merely sentient creatures) and 'Pragmatism' (explaining conceptual content in terms of the practice of applying concepts, rather than assuming content is a fixed Platonic entity).",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic begins by destabilizing the intuition that language is primarily a tool for labeling objects (Representationalism). Brandom subverts this by positing that 'awareness' itself—specifically *sapience*—is a normative status conferred by participating in a game of giving and asking for reasons. This move demotes 'Reference' from a primitive axiom to a derived capacity; one can only represent the world if one can first infer consequences. This establishes the 'Pragmatist' vector: the *act* (praxis) of discursive reasoning precedes and constitutes the *object* (content) of thought.",

Brandom rejects the strategy of 'Assimilation' which tries to build mind out of matter continuously.

The author defines this 'explicitation' as transforming 'knowing-how' into 'knowing-that'. The core argument asserts that the conceptual is distinguished not by intensionality, but by 'inferential articulation'—the role a claim plays in reasoning. This establishes a 'rationalist pragmatism' where to express something is to authorize it as a premise in an inference, reversing the traditional Platonist order of explanation by deriving the concept of truth from the act of assertion.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The inquiry begins by confronting the limitations of traditional models: the representational 'wax tablet' and the romantic 'gesture'. Both treat the inner and outer as separable. The argument sublates these into a 'Relational Expressivism', where the act of expressing and the content expressed are mutually constitutive; one cannot understand the belief apart from the assertion. \n\nThis unity evolves into the mechanism of 'Explicitation'. Here, the movement is not spatial (inner to outer) but structural (implicit to explicit). The primitive pragmatist basis of 'knowing-how' (doing) is codified into 'knowing-that' (saying). \n\nHowever, a crucial distinction emerges: what makes this 'saying' specifically *conceptual*? The text rejects simple intensionality (substitution) as the primary mark. Instead, it posits 'Inferential Articulation'. To possess a concept is to master its use in a normative game of giving and asking for reasons. \n\nThis leads to the formulation of 'Rationalist Pragmatism'. Unlike classical pragmatism which might focus solely on utility, this view focuses on the 'authority' and 'responsibility' inherent in making a claim. To assert is to offer a premise for potential inference. Finally, this necessitates a reversal of the 'Platonist order of explanation': rather than assuming an abstract notion of Truth to explain Assertion, we must analyze the social practice of Assertion to reconstruct the concept of Truth.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk contains the critical 'inversion' of standard semantic theory. Brandom explicitly contrasts his 'Rationalist Pragmatism' with both 'Assimilationist' pragmatism (Dewey, Heidegger) and 'Platonist' semantics (Frege/Russell).

        "summary": "This section refines the definition of expressivism, moving away from a Romantic model of 'squeezing out' inner feelings to a Pragmatist model of making explicit implicit practical abilities. It argues that conceptual activity is a species of 'knowing that' derived from a genus of 'knowing how.' The text introduces 'Rationalist Pragmatism,' asserting that the conceptual is distinguished specifically by its inferential articulation—its role in the game of giving and asking for reasons. Furthermore, it inverts the traditional Platonist order of explanation, deriving the semantic content of concepts (truth) from the pragmatic activity of asserting (doing).",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The argument advances by sublating the primitive notion of expression. Where earlier models might view expression as the externalization of an internal datum (like a seal on wax), the text redefines expression as the transformation of 'knowing how' (subjective practical mastery) into 'knowing that' (objective conceptual claim). This establishes a 'Relational Expressivism,' where the content of a belief cannot be understood apart from the linguistic practice of expressing it.\n\nCrucially, this leads to the definition of the *conceptual* itself. Unlike representationalism, which focuses on reference, or standard pragmatism, which focuses on use, this 'Rationalist Pragmatism' identifies the conceptual by its 'inferential articulation.' To grasp a concept is to master its role in reasoning—to know what follows from it and what it follows from. Thus, the normative dimension of 'responsibility' and 'authority' in inference becomes the constitutive ground of meaning, replacing the abstract Platonist notion of Truth as the primary explanatory primitive.",
        "interpretive_notes": "The text explicitly critiques both standard Representationalism and Poststructuralism (which it claims is still trapped in a representational paradigm of signifier-signifier relations). It positions Brandom's project as 'exceptionalist' (focusing on what makes sapience unique) rather than 'assimilationist' (blurring the line between human and animal). The 'Frege's Pragmatic Principle' mentioned serves as the pivot point: instead of defining assertion via Truth, Brandom defines Truth via the norms of Assertion."

This implies that 'Form' is an abstraction drawn from 'Matter', not a pre-existing cage that Matter fills. Consequently, Logic is redefined not as the foundation of thought, but as a secondary, expressive tool derived from the robustness of material practice.",

It argues that logical concepts like negation are derived from these practical normative relations, rather than the reverse. Historically, it reframes the Enlightenment as a conflict between Representationalism (Empiricism) and Inferentialism (Rationalism), siding with the latter to claim that representational content is a function of inferential role. Finally, it asserts that even non-inferential observational reports depend on this inferential articulation to possess conceptual content.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The investigation into sapience now zooms in to reveal its internal mechanism. We previously established that sapience is normative; now we see that this normativity is not a monolith but a dynamic tension between two distinct statuses: **Commitment** (what one is obliged to defend) and **Entitlement** (what one is authorized to hold).\n\nThis distinction generates the 'fine structure of rationality.' Inference is no longer just a movement from premise to conclusion but is differentiated into:\n1.  **Commitment-preserving inferences** (Deductive moves: if committed to p, then committed to q).\n2.  **Entitlement-preserving inferences** (Inductive moves: if entitled to p, then entitled to q).\n3.  **Incompatibility** (The critical friction: commitment to p precludes entitlement to q).\n\nThis third relation, **Incompatibility**, is identified as the primitive root of **Negation** and logical contradiction. Logic does not impose negation from above; negation emerges expansively from the practical inability to maintain entitlement to conflicting commitments.\n\nCrucially, the text performs a 'sublation' of the history of philosophy. It re-reads the Rationalists (Spinoza, Leibniz) not as metaphysicians but as proto-Inferentialists who understood that **Representation** (referring to the world) is an achievement of **Inference** (reasoning), contra the Empiricists who tried to build reasoning out of atomistic representations. This solidifies the move from 'Semantics' to 'Pragmatics': the objective authority of things is explained by the normative structure of our attitudes.",
        "interpretive_notes": "The definition of negation as 'minimum incompatibility' is a key logical expressivist move. It shifts modal logic from truth-tables to social pragmatics. Also, the 'Sage of Pittsburgh' (Sellars) is explicitly invoked to deny the 'Myth of the Given': observation (`s(Observation)`) is not an autonomous foundation but a node in the inferential network (`n(Inference)`)."

The text then establishes Semantic Holism—the view that to have one concept is necessarily to have many—and retrieves the historical precedent of the 'Young Frege' (1879), who defined conceptual content strictly through inferential role rather than truth conditions.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The investigation begins by confronting the 'Parrot Problem': what distinguishes a parrot trained to squawk 'That is red' from a human reporter making a genuine claim? Both exhibit reliable differential responsiveness to stimuli. However, the analysis reveals that reliable response is merely a causal classification, common to thermostats and chunks of iron. Normative, conceptual classification emerges only when the response is caught up in a web of consequences—knowing that 'red' implies 'colored' and precludes 'green.'\n\nThis necessitates a move to Inferential Holism. Because a concept is defined by its relations to other concepts, the mastery of a single concept is impossible in isolation; it is 'the sound of one hand clapping.' Consequently, there can be no autonomous language game of pure observation (non-inferential reporting) without a background of inferential practice. The capacity to 'see' conceptually is parasitic on the capacity to reason inferentially.\n\nFinally, the dialectic reaches back into history to ground this view in the 'Young Frege' of the *Begriffsschrift*. Before the later turn to truth-conditional semantics, Frege explicitly defined 'conceptual content' (*begriffliche Inhalt*) as that which remains invariant across different inferential structures. Two judgments share content if and only if they share the same inferential consequences. This identifies the core of logic not as the study of static Truth, but as the dynamic hierarchy of Inference.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk performs a critical 'sublation of the empiricist given.' The immediate report (observation) is shown not to be a foundational atom, but a derivative function of a holistic system. The retrieval of the 'Young Frege' serves to destabilize the standard analytic narrative that prioritizes Reference and Truth, replacing them with Inference as the primitive explanatory category. This connects the modern pragmatism of Sellars back to the logical roots of analytic philosophy."

This dogma attempts to reduce the rich, content-dependent reasoning of everyday life (e.g., inferring thunder from lightning) to a skeletal structure of logical form, hiding the material connections behind suppressed premises (enthymemes). This reduction strips concepts of their intrinsic power, rendering them inert variables waiting for a logical operator to animate them.\n\nIn response, the analysis necessitates the emergence of **Material Inference**. Here, the movement of thought is driven not by external logical laws, but by the internal content of the concepts themselves. To grasp the concept 'West' is to already be moving toward 'East'. This normative force is primitive; it is not a 'logical' compulsion but a 'material' propriety.\n\nConsequently, the status of **Formal Validity** is radically transformed. It is no longer the foundation of rationality but a derivative abstraction—a specific subset of material inferences that remain good regardless of how one swaps out the non-logical terms. Logic does not ground meaning; meaning grounds logic. The 'Formal' is revealed to be a compressive stabilization of the 'Material', achieved through the mechanism of Substitution.",

This view strips concepts of their inherent normative power, rendering them 'intellectually nude' and dependent on abstract logical connectives for their movement. \n\nWe reject this formalist reduction. Instead, we posit that material inference is the compressive core of rationality. It is not that we reason formally with hidden premises; rather, we reason materially, and 'formal validity' is merely an expansive abstraction derived from these material practices. By holding certain vocabulary fixed (logical vocabulary) and varying the rest, we can identify a subset of inferences that remain good regardless of content—this is formal validity.

The author argues, following Sellars, that conceptual content is determined by the material correctness of transitions (e.g., from 'lightning' to 'thunder') rather than formal logical validity. Formal validity is revealed to be a derivative notion, constructed by observing which material inferences remain good under the substitution of non-logical vocabulary.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic moves from the abstract necessity of Logic to the concrete necessity of Material Practice. Previously, we established that expression makes implicit practice explicit. Now, we confront a specific resistance: the 'Formalist Dogma.' This dogma attempts to strip the world of its inherent rational structure by claiming that only empty logical forms are truly valid, and that any reasoning involving concrete content (like lightning or streets) is defective unless bolstered by hidden logical premises.\n\nMaterial Inferentialism enters to sublate this dogma. It asserts that the 'goodness' of an inference between facts is not a shadow of logic, but the very substance of meaning itself. To possess a concept is to be caught up in these material currents—to know that 'West' necessitates 'East.'\n\nConsequently, the status of Logic changes. It is no longer the hidden foundation making reasoning possible; it is a structural byproduct. We derive 'Formal Validity' by taking 'Material Correctness' and subjecting it to a process of substitution. If an inference holds regardless of how we change its content, we call it logically valid. Thus, the rigid, compressive necessity of Logic is actually resting upon the expansive, living practice of material inference.",

Instead of Logic -> Inference, we have Material Inference -> Substitution -> Logic.

The text critiques the 'formalist' dogma which treats material inferences as merely enthymematic (incomplete) logical deductions, arguing that this view leads to an infinite regress (Lewis Carroll's problem). Instead, logical validity is presented as a derivative category, defined through the mechanism of substitution upon a foundation of primitive material correctness.",

Now, we must distinguish between the 'Form' and 'Content' of that inference. The immediate assumption—that rationality equates to Logical Form—is exposed as an abstraction that cannot ground itself. The text introduces 'Material Inference' as the concrete, living practice of reasoning based on the specific content of concepts (like 'East' and 'West').\n\nThis move reverses the traditional hierarchy. Rather than Content being a filling for Logical Forms, Logical Form is revealed to be an expansive abstraction derived from Material Content. The mechanism of this derivation is 'Substitution': logical validity is simply a material inference that remains 'good' regardless of how we swap out its non-logical parts. This confirms that the Normative (the goodness of inference) precedes the Logical (the validity of form). The Subject does not start with empty logic and apply it to the world; the Subject starts with a world-laden practice of material inference, from which logic is distilled.",

If we treat 'Lightning implies Thunder' as needing the hidden premise 'If Lightning then Thunder' to be valid, we require a logical principle to validate the material move. However, applying that logical principle requires yet another rule, leading to the regress Achilles demonstrates to the Tortoise. Brandom stops the regress by positing Material Inference as 'primitive'—it is valid not because of its form, but because of the concepts involved. This sublates Formalism into Materialism (in the inferential sense)."

        "summary": "This section critiques the 'Formalist Dogma'—the belief that the validity of an inference depends solely on its logical form, requiring all substantive inferences to be treated as enthymemes with suppressed premises. Brandom, following Sellars, argues for the primacy of 'Material Inference.' Here, the correctness of reasoning is determined directly by the specific conceptual contents (e.g., 'West' implies 'East') rather than abstract logical structures. Formal validity is then revealed to be a derivative notion, constructed expansively by observing which material inferences remain good under the subjective operation of substitution.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic faces a critical junction concerning the nature of Reason itself. Previously, we established that content is inferential. Now, we confront the structural question: Is this inference grounded in an abstract, empty Logic (Formalism), or is Logic merely the shadow cast by concrete, content-rich reasoning (Materialism)?\n\nThe 'Formalist Dogma' posits that an inference like 'It is raining, therefore the street is wet' is technically incomplete; it yearns for the expansion of a hidden conditional ('If raining, then wet') to validate it. This view treats the particular content of the world as a defect to be cured by the universality of Form. However, this leads to an infinite regress (the Lewis Carroll problem), where every rule requires a rule to apply it, effectively paralyzing the Subject in a Void of infinite preconditions.\n\nSellars and Brandom reverse this polarity. They assert that 'Material Inference'—reasoning based on the specific, objective relations of concepts like Lightning and Thunder—is the compressive core of rationality. We do not infer because we possess a logic; we possess a logic because we can infer. Formal validity is shown to be an 'expansive' derivative: it is what remains when we subject our material inferences to the variation of non-logical vocabulary. Thus, the Normative force of reason flows from the concrete to the abstract, not the other way around. Logic is the tool for making the implicit material practice explicit, not the engine that drives it.",
        "interpretive_notes": "The distinction between 'compressive' and 'expansive' is vital here. Material inference is compressive because it binds two specific contents (Lightning/Thunder) immediately. Formalism is expansive because it seeks to generalize this bond into a universal law valid for all contents. The error of Formalism is mistaking the expansive result for the compressive cause."

The text reverses this polarity: the Normative force of reasoning arises from the 'material' interactions of concepts (e.g., the specific relation of West to East). Formal logic is then reconstructed as a compressive necessity—a specific subset of material inferences that remain valid regardless of the non-logical vocabulary substituted.

This reduces the richness of worldly determination to a skeleton of empty syntax.\n\nWe negate this abstraction. By deploying the concept of Material Inference, we assert that the specific, worldly connection between concepts (Lightning and Thunder, West and East) is the primitive engine of rationality. Concepts do not *have* inferential roles added to them; they *are* these roles. Logic, then, is not the foundation of the building but the 'flying buttresses'—a secondary, expansive structure derived from and supporting the primary material inferences. Formal validity is thus sublated: it is no longer the definition of Good Reason, but a specific, derivative tool for explicating the material proprieties that constitute reality.",

Thus, the rationality of the subject is grounded in the material grasp of worldly concepts, not in an antecedent logical calculus.",

This text sublates that formalist view. We now see that 'Logic' is not the engine of meaning but the 'skeleton' derived from the living body of material inference. The concept of 'Validity' is redefined: it is not a pre-existing law of the universe, but an expressive artifact created by stabilizing certain vocabularies within the flux of material practice.",

Now, we ask: How does practice become conscious of itself? \n\nSellars answers with the 'Socratic method': a movement that transforms implicit 'doings' (inferential practices) into explicit 'sayings' (rules and assertions). Here, the Subjective act of inferring undergoes an *expansive* shift, becoming an Objective claim that can be challenged. This is the birth of the 'Inference License'—a modal statement that permits a move from premises to conclusions.\n\nSimultaneously, we revisit Frege. The text sublates the traditional view of logic (as a mere formal calculus, exemplified by Boole) into a robust 'Concept-Script' (*Begriffsschrift*). Frege's logic is revealed not as a static grid of truth-tables, but as a dynamic tool for the *codification* of material content. The logical conditional ($A \\to B$) is identified as the objective crystallization of the subjective act of inferring $B$ from $A$. Thus, logic is the organ by which the implicit Normative structure of the conceptual becomes explicit to itself.",

The author argues that rationality consists primarily in the capacity to transform implicit practical commitments (what we do) into explicit theoretical claims (what we say). This transformation exposes our habits to 'rational control'—the game of giving and asking for reasons. Frege's 'Begriffsschrift' (Concept-Script) is reinterpreted here not as a formal emptiness, but as 'logical cement'—a mechanism for codifying the material inferences of science so they can be objectively grasped and critiqued.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic advances by moving from the definition of inference as a primitive 'doing' to the necessity of its expression as a 'saying.' \n\nPreviously, we established that conceptual content rests on material inference. Now, the text introduces the 'Socratic Method' and 'Logical Expressivism' as the mechanisms that sublimate this subjective practice into objective form. The Subject, who initially only possesses 'implicit' know-how, encounters the necessity of 'explicitation.' This occurs through the deployment of logical vocabulary—specifically the conditional.\n\nHere, the 'conditional' is revealed not merely as a truth-functional operator, but as the expansive tool that allows the Subject to say, 'If A, then B,' thereby codifying the material habit of treating A as a reason for B. This act of expression is expansive because it moves the content from the private dark of implicit habit into the public light of the 'game of giving and asking for reasons.'\n\nHowever, this expansion immediately necessitates a new compression: once the rule is made explicit (Subject becomes Object), it falls under 'rational control' (Normative). The rule can now be challenged, justified, or rejected. Thus, Logic acts as the 'cement' that binds the objective content, stabilizing the fluid practices of the subject into a coherent, navigable system.",
        "interpretive_notes": "Brandom (via the author) performs a crucial reading of Frege here. He rejects the Boole/Schroder view of logic as a formal calculus applied *to* content, and instead adopts the Fregean view of logic as the *structure* of content itself. The 'conditional' is the hero of this section because it is the bridge between 'doing' (inferring) and 'saying' (claiming). Note the strong emphasis on 'rational control'—expression is not just for show; it is for the sake of critical agency."

He argues that while reliability explains truth-possession, it cannot account for conceptual content or belief itself, which requires participation in a normative network of inferential articulation.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The inquiry proceeds by subjecting the concept of 'Reliability' to a stress test: can a community exist that is perfectly reliable yet entirely bereft of reasons? The analysis reveals that such a community would not be a community of knowers, but merely a collection of measuring instruments. This exposes the fundamental distinction between the objective status of being a reliable indicator (like iron rusting in dampness or a land mine exploding under pressure) and the normative status of possessing a belief.\n\nThe text introduces the 'Parrot Argument' to delineate the boundary of the conceptual. A parrot trained to cry 'Red!' in the presence of red objects is causally reliable but normatively mute; it makes noise, not a move in the game of giving and asking for reasons. Genuine belief requires 'Inferential Articulation'—the capacity for the claim to serve as a premise and a conclusion in further reasoning. Without this normative connectivity, a response to a stimulus remains merely causal, belonging to the order of nature (sentience/mechanism) rather than the order of knowledge (sapience).\n\nThis leads to the identification of the 'Conceptual Blindspot' of reliabilism. By focusing solely on how beliefs are justified (reliability), reliabilism ignores what constitutes a belief in the first place (inferential role). The dialectic concludes that reason-giving practices are 'autonomous'—intelligible in themselves—whereas reliability is parasitic, serving as a subordinate condition for knowledge but incapable of generating the semantic content necessary for knowledge to exist.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk is crucial for establishing the 'Discontinuity' between nature and spirit (or sentience and sapience). Brandom uses the 'Parrot' and 'Iron Rusting' examples to show that causal reliability is ubiquitous in nature and insufficient for cognition. The logic here moves from the 'Expansive' (analyzing reliability) to the 'Compressive' (defining belief strictly through inferential articulation). This is a definitive rejection of reductionist naturalism in semantics, even if naturalism is permitted in epistemology."

The author argues that while Reliabilism attempts to replace normative justification with objective probability, this move fails because 'objective probability' is strictly relative to a 'reference class.' The choice of reference class is determined by subjective explanatory interests, not by raw nature. The famous 'Barn Facade' thought experiment is deployed to demonstrate that neither internal justification nor external causal links are sufficient for knowledge, necessitating a normative account of reliability that accounts for environmental context.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic moves from the Thesis of Naturalized Epistemology (knowledge as reliable belief) to its Antithesis via the Reference Class Problem. The text initially tempts us with the idea that if belief and truth are natural, knowledge is simply 'probable truth.' However, the concept of 'Probability' is analyzed and found to lack self-subsistence; it requires a Reference Class to be intelligible. Since the world does not self-identify its own reference classes (nature does not say 'count me as a member of Barn Facade County' vs. 'count me as a visually accessible object'), the determination of reliability falls back upon the subjective interests of the inquirer. This generates the 'Barn Facade' paradox: a subject can have a true belief, justified by evidence, and caused by the object, yet fail to know because of the modal fragility of the environment (the nearby fakes). This reveals that 'Knowledge' is not a static property of a mental state's causal history, but a normative status dependent on how we classify the environment.",

If 'reliability' depends on the reference class (e.g., 'barns in this county' vs. 'barns I am looking at'), and the reference class is interest-relative, then 'Knowledge' cannot be reduced to a purely physical fact. It retains a normative, hermeneutic dimension."

        "summary": "This section examines the tension between Reliabilism (externalist knowledge) and Justificatory Internalism (reasons-based knowledge). Brandom utilizes thought experiments like 'super blindsight' and the 'naive chicken-sexer' to test whether knowledge can exist without the subject possessing a reason for their belief. He concludes that while 'cognitively irresponsible' beliefs (beliefs held without subjective reasons) can count as knowledge in isolated, local instances (like faith or reliable mechanisms), they cannot constitute a global, autonomous practice of sapience. A community cannot consist entirely of 'blind' reliable reporters; the normative practice of giving reasons is the necessary autonomous background against which local exceptions of reliability become intelligible.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic advances by subjecting the definition of Knowledge to a stress test between the Subjective (internal justification) and the Objective (external reliability). \n\nInitially, the 'Founding Insight' of Reliabilism suggests that the Objective mechanism of truth-production is sufficient for knowledge, rendering the Subjective awareness of reasons superfluous. This is exemplified by the 'super blindsight' subject, who possesses the objective fact (the truth) via a reliable mechanism but lacks the subjective mediation (the reason or awareness of seeing).\n\nThe text first allows Internalism to counter-attack: if the subject *knows* they are reliable, that reliability itself becomes a Subjective reason ('I believe this because I am a reliable sensor'), thus re-absorbing the external mechanism into the internal space of reasons. \n\nHowever, Brandom pushes the dialectic to its limit: what if the subject *does not* believe they are reliable? This produces the concept of 'Cognitive Irresponsibility'—holding a belief without a corresponding entitlement. Brandom concedes that such states are *possible* (expanding the scope of what counts as belief to include 'blind' conviction). \n\nYet, this expansion is immediately subjected to a compressive constraint: the 'Asymmetry of Autonomy.' While a system of rational justification can exist autonomously (a community of reason-givers), a system of pure reliability cannot. We can imagine a language game of reasons, but we cannot coherently imagine a language game consisting *entirely* of blind reliable reporters. Therefore, while reliability is a valid *local* mechanism for acquiring beliefs, it remains dependent on the *global* normative structure of the Space of Reasons. The Objective mechanism is sublated; it is preserved as a generative force but subordinated to the Normative necessity of social justification.",
        "interpretive_notes": "Brandom is making a crucial topological distinction here between 'local' possibilities and 'global' structural necessities. He grants the externalist the 'token' (individual cases of knowledge without reasons exist) but denies them the 'type' (the practice of knowledge cannot be modeled solely on these cases). This preserves the 'Discontinuity of Sapience' established earlier: Sapience is not just high-grade Sentience (reliability); it is a distinct, autonomous game of reasons that can, secondarily, incorporate non-rational mechanisms."

Brandom argues that while thermometers and parrots may be reliable indicators of the environment, they do not possess beliefs because their responses lack 'inferential articulation.' To believe is not merely to reliably respond to stimuli, but to occupy a node in a normative network of commitments, serving as premises and conclusions in reasoning. Consequently, the intelligibility of reliability is revealed to be parasitic on the primary practice of giving and asking for reasons.",

We encounter a sharp rupture between the 'Reliable Indicator' (Chunk of Iron, Landmine, Parrot) and the 'Genuine Believer.' \n\nThe central tension is the definition of sapience. If knowledge is merely true belief reliably produced, then a rusting piece of iron 'knows' it is wet. Brandom rejects this by introducing the concept of **Inferential Articulation**. \n\nThe narrative establishes that the 'Game of Reliability' is not autonomous; one cannot play it without first playing the 'Game of Reasons.' A community that only possessed reliable indicators but no concept of inference could not understand itself as reliable. Thus, the category of the objective (Reliability) is shown to be structurally dependent on the normative (Reasoning). The parrot acts as the dialectical limit: it possesses the objective behavior (vocalization) and the causal connection (reliability), but lacks the normative status (commitment/entitlement), proving that Sapience is a discontinuous step up from Sentience.",

        "summary": "This section critiques the naturalistic ambition of Reliabilism by exposing the normative presuppositions hidden within the concept of objective probability. The author argues that while Reliabilism hopes to reduce 'Knowledge' to 'Truth + Belief + Reliability' (where reliability is construed as objective likelihood), this project fails because objective likelihood is strictly relative to a reference class. The selection of a reference class is not a natural fact found in the world but a determination made by subjective interests (explanatory concerns). Using Alvin Goldman's 'Barn Facade' thought experiment, the text demonstrates that neither justification nor causal connection is sufficient for knowledge if the environmental context renders the belief only accidentally true. Thus, the attempt to naturalize epistemology inevitably circles back to the necessity of normative, pragmatic determinations.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic advances by interrogating the concept of **Reliability**. Initially posited as a bridge that could carry epistemology from the normative realm of 'reasons' to the naturalistic realm of 'objective likelihood,' Reliability is revealed to be structurally dependent on the Subject.\n\n1.  **The Naturalistic Ambition**: The text begins with the Reliabilist's conditional: *If* belief and truth are naturalized, and *if* reliability is just objective probability, *then* knowledge is naturalized. This is an **expansive** move, attempting to dissolve the distinctively normative status of knowledge into physical facts.\n\n2.  **The Reference Class Sublation**: The analysis halts this expansion by identifying a **compressive** necessity within probability itself. An objective probability exists only relative to a **Reference Class**. The world, viewed naturalistically, does not privilege one reference class over another; *we* do, based on our explanatory interests. Therefore, 'natural' reliability secretly relies on 'normative' selection.\n\n3.  **The Barn Facade Defeater**: Goldman's famous example serves as the concrete universal of this tension. The subject sees a real barn in a county of fakes. The belief is true, justified, and causally connected. Yet, it is not knowledge. Why? Because relative to the reference class 'objects in this county,' the reliability is low. Relative to 'objects currently looked at,' it is high. The inability of the causal chain itself to adjudicate this confirms that **Knowledge** cannot be reduced to causal mechanisms but requires a normative context that defines the relevant scope of judgment.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk is pivotal because it deconstructs the 'Founding Insight' of Reliabilism (that knowledge is true belief produced by a reliable mechanism) to reveal an 'Implicit Insight' (that reliability is interest-relative). Brandom uses the Barn Facade case not just to stump causal theories, but to prove that 'objective probability' is not a foundation that precedes the Subject, but a construct that requires the Subject's interpretive engagement (reference class selection). This preserves the primacy of the Normative over the Natural."

The text introduces the *Reference Class Problem*. For a mechanism to be 'reliable' (objectively likely to produce truth), it must be assessed against a specific background class of cases. In the *Barn Facade* example, the perceiver's belief is reliable relative to the immediate causal chain (looking at a real barn) but unreliable relative to the geographic context (Barn Facade County). \n\nHere lies the dialectical turn: The 'objective' probability relies on a specific framing (the reference class). But the world as a pure collection of natural facts does not privilege one reference class over another; *we* do, based on explanatory interests.

This assumes 'reliability' is a raw objective datum, like mass or velocity. \n\nHowever, the 'Barn Facade' case serves as the negation of this simplicity. It introduces a scenario where the subjective experience (perception) and the objective causality (photon path) are perfect, yet knowledge is absent due to the modal context (the surrounding facades). \n\nThis reveals that 'Objective Probability' is structurally indeterminate. It is an expansive void that can only be collapsed into a specific value (and thus a judgment of reliability) by the introduction of a Reference Class. Crucially, the text asserts that the objective world (Nature) does not determine this class; Subjective Interest does. \n\nThus, the concept of Knowledge sublates the causal theory: it preserves the necessity of true belief and causal connection but negates their sufficiency, revealing that Knowledge is a normative status constituted by the synthesis of objective facts and subjective interests (the choice of reference class).",

By introducing the 'Reference Class Problem' and analyzing Goldman's 'Barn Facade' thought experiment, the text argues that objective probability is not a raw physical fact but requires a reference class determined by subjective explanatory interests. Consequently, causal connections and objective likelihoods alone are insufficient to constitute knowledge without a normative determination of the relevant context.",

The text begins by entertaining the 'Founding Insight' of reliabilism: the hope that Knowledge can be reduced to a reliable belief-forming mechanism, which in turn is reduced to objective physical probability. \n\nHowever, a fatal flaw is exposed in this reductionist chain: the 'Reference Class Problem.' The text demonstrates that 'objective probability' is not a standalone feature of the physical world. A probability can only be calculated relative to a specific set of possibilities (a reference class), and the world itself does not privilege one class over another. The selection of this class is a function of Subjective Interest. Thus, the attempt to expel the Subject from epistemology by appealing to 'objective likelihood' inadvertently smuggles the Subject back in as the determiner of the reference class.\n\nThis dialectical reversal is illustrated through the 'Barn Facade' case. Here, a subject possesses a True Belief with a perfect Causal connection to the object (a real barn). Yet, because of the modal context (the surrounding fakes), the subject lacks Knowledge. This proves that mere causal efficacy (the 'Golden Chain') is insufficient. The status of Knowledge depends on the 'modal environment'—what *would* have happened in counterfactual situations—which is defined by the reference class. The Causal Theory is thus sublated: preserved as necessary for perception, but canceled as a sufficient definition of Knowledge.",

While reliabilism seeks to replace normative notions of justification with objective probabilities (reliability), the text argues that objective probability is indeterminate without the specification of a reference class. Since the physical world does not privilege one reference class over another, the choice is a subjective function of inquiry, not a brute natural fact. This is illustrated by Goldman's 'Barn Facade' example, which demonstrates that a subject can possess a true belief, good reasons, and a perfect causal connection to the object, yet fail to possess knowledge due to the external context (the prevalence of fakes), rendering the truth of the belief accidental.",

However, this shift encounters a critical rupture: the 'Reference Class Problem.' The text reveals that 'Objective Probability' is not a self-subsisting natural fact but a relational property dependent on a Reference Class. Because nature (the Objective) does not self-select its own reference classes, the Subject must intervene to frame the probability. This eats the 'Naturalistic' pretension of reliabilism, showing that even the most objective-seeming metrics depend on a subjective or normative framing. The Barn Facade case serves as the material contradiction that forces this realization: causal perfection is insufficient for knowledge if the modal context (what *could* have happened in that county) undermines the stability of the truth.",

Brandom (via the critique of reliabilism) is showing that 'Probability' behaves like 'Meaning'—it requires a context/background (Reference Class) to be determinate. This foreshadows the idea that 'Nature' is only intelligible through 'Normative' categories of classification. The Barn Facade example is treated here not just as a counter-example, but as a proof of the insufficiency of causal connections to ground normative status (Knowledge)."

Using Goldman's Barn Facade example, the text demonstrates that the proper reference class is not determined by physical facts alone but by explanatory interests. Consequently, the definition of knowledge cannot be purely naturalistic because it requires a non-naturalistic selection of context to distinguish genuine knowledge from accidental truth.",

Here, 'reliability' functions as the bridge between the subjective act of believing and the objective status of knowing.\n\nHowever, the analysis reveals that 'reliability' is not a raw physical property (like mass) but a statistical one: **Objective Probability**. Probability, critically, exists only relative to a **Reference Class**. The **Barn Facade** example serves as the dialectical pivot. It shows a subject who meets all causal and internalist criteria (justified true belief, proper causal chain) yet lacks knowledge because their belief is only accidentally true relative to the wider environment (the county of fake barns).\n\nThis leads to the **Implicit Insight**: The physical world itself does not privilege one reference class (e.g., 'objects currently in front of me') over another (e.g., 'objects in this county'). The selection of the reference class is driven by subjective **Explanatory Interests**. Therefore, the 'objective' grounding of knowledge in probability turns out to be dependent on a subjective determination of relevance. The attempt to eliminate the Subject from the definition of Knowledge fails, as the Subject returns in the very criteria of objectivity (probability) chosen to replace it.",

        "summary": "Brandom critiques the ambition of naturalistic epistemology to reduce the normative concept of knowledge to the objective concept of reliability. While reliabilism promises that knowledge is simply true belief produced by a reliable mechanism (defined by objective probability), Brandom identifies a fatal flaw: the Reference Class Problem. Using Goldman's 'Barn Facade' example, he demonstrates that the reliability of a mechanism cannot be determined by physical facts alone, as it depends entirely on which reference class is selected to assess probability. Since the choice of reference class is a function of subjective explanatory interests rather than raw nature, the attempt to fully naturalize knowledge without appealing to the subject's normative activity fails.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The text opens with the seductive promise of **Naturalistic Reliabilism**: the idea that if we can explain belief and truth in terms of physics or biology, we can explain knowledge by adding 'objective probability.' This represents a **Compressive** movement, attempting to collapse the normative dimension of 'justification' into the objective dimension of 'likelihood.'\n\nHowever, the dialectic immediately encounters an **Expansive** obstacle: the nature of probability itself. Brandom argues that probability is strictly relative to a **Reference Class**. The physical world, stripped of human concerns, does not privilege one reference class over another. Therefore, 'objective' probability implies a hidden dependence on **Subjective Explanatory Interests**.\n\nTo illustrate this, the text deploys the **Barn Facade** antinomy. Here, an agent possesses a justified, true belief via a causally perfect mechanism. Yet, because of the environmental context (the fake barns), the belief is merely accidental. This scenario serves two logical functions: it negates Internalism (internal justification is insufficient) and negates Causal Naturalism (the local causal chain is insufficient). The status of 'knowledge' depends on a global assessment of reliability, which in turn depends on how we define the relevant environment (the reference class). Thus, the 'Founding Insight' of reliabilism—that knowledge is based on objective reliability—is sublated. It is preserved as valid, but only if we recognize that 'reliability' is not a brute fact, but a status conferred by the subjective act of classification.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk is pivotal because it deconstructs the 'Objectivity' of probability. By showing that probability requires a reference class, and reference classes require explanatory interests, Brandom effectively subsumes 'Science' under 'Pragmatics.' This reinforces the global axiom that the Objective is constituted by the Subjective (AX_PRAGMATIST_GROUNDING). The Barn Facade case is treated not just as a counter-example, but as a proof of the non-reducibility of the normative context."

However, the analysis reveals a fatal gap: 'Objective Probability' is not a raw fact of nature but is indeterminate without a 'Reference Class.' The choice of this class is a Subjective (or pragmatic) determination, not a physical one. The 'Barn Facade' case serves as the concrete universal that shatters the simple causal theory: one can have a true belief, causally connected to the object, yet fail to know because the modal environment (the 'county' of fakes) renders the truth accidental. This re-introduces the necessity of a normative or subjective frame (the reference class) to stabilize objective facts, proving that Knowledge cannot be fully naturalized without residue.",
        "interpretive_notes": "The 'Reference Class Problem' is interpreted here as a manifestation of the Subject's role in constituting the Object. The 'World' does not self-sort into probabilities; the Subject must impose a frame (Reference Class) to make probability intelligible. This mirrors the earlier axiom that 'Structure requires Limit.' The Barn Facade example illustrates that 'Truth' is not merely a static correspondence (local match) but requires 'Modal Robustness' (stability across counterfactuals), which is a feature of the System (Context), not just the atomic Fact."

The author argues that this reduction fails because 'objective probability' is always relative to a 'reference class,' and the choice of the relevant reference class is not a natural fact but a perspective-dependent determination. Alvin Goldman's 'Barn Facade' thought experiment is used to demonstrate that neither internal justification nor valid causal chains are sufficient for knowledge if the broader environment (the reference class context) renders the belief merely accidentally true.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "Having established the primacy of normative inference over representation, the inquiry now tests the resilience of the 'Normative' against the 'Natural.' The concept of Knowledge faces the 'Naturalistic Temptation': the desire to reduce the status of 'knowing' to a physical mechanism of 'reliability.' The text exposes the dialectical flaw in this reduction: Reliability depends on Probability, and Probability depends on a Reference Class. Because the objective world does not uniquely privilege one reference class over another, the determination of reliability essentially requires a Subjective selection (an interpretive stance). Thus, the attempt to eliminate the Subject fails, and the Normative structure of Knowledge is shown to encompass the Objective environment (the Barn Facades) only through the mediation of the Subject's classificatory interests. The 'Barn Facade' case serves as the negating moment that sublates both internalist justification (which ignores the environment) and causal externalism (which ignores the problem of the reference class), forcing a move toward a social-perspectival account of knowledge.",
        "interpretive_notes": "The crucial move here is the 'Reference Class Problem' serving as the wedge that prevents the total collapse of Epistemology into Physics. This echoes the earlier theme that 'Reference' is derived from 'Inference'—here, 'Probability' (a form of reference to the world) is shown to depend on 'Classification' (an inferential/normative decision). The Barn Facade example is treated not just as a counter-example, but as a demonstration of the 'Expansive' nature of the environment interacting with the 'Compressive' nature of the definition of knowledge."

Previously posited as a potential anchor for a naturalized epistemology (where knowledge is explained by objective causal mechanisms), reliability is now shown to be indeterminate without a normative act of description. The **Reference Class Problem** reveals that nature contains infinite overlapping frequencies, none of which inherently claims priority. This **Expansive Indeterminacy** forces a retreat from **Naturalism** (the idea that facts settle norms) back to **Normativity**. The system then sublates Reliability into the structure of **Knowledge Attribution**. Knowledge is redefined not as a natural state, but as a complex normative status composed of **Commitment** (taking a stance in an inferential network) and **Entitlement** (having the authority to hold that stance). Reliability survives not as a physical mechanism, but as a ground for attributing entitlement—it becomes a form of **Inference**.",
        "interpretive_notes": "The 'Barn Facade' case serves here as a logical operator: it demonstrates that 'objective' reliability is strictly relative to 'subjective' description. This collapses the distinction between externalist mechanisms and internalist reasons, as the 'mechanism' can only be individuated through a descriptive (concept-laden) act. This prepares the ground for treating reliability attributions as a species of social-normative practice (attributing entitlements) rather than mere biological description."

While reliabilism correctly identifies that knowledge requires more than internal justification—specifically, an external connection to truth—the attempt to define this connection via 'objective probability' fails. The text argues that objective probability is indeterminate without the specification of a reference class, a choice that is not determined by the physical world itself but by subjective interests. This is illustrated through Goldman's 'Barn Facade' thought experiment, which demonstrates that justified true belief can fail to be knowledge if the environment renders the belief only accidentally true. Thus, the definition of reliability (and knowledge) remains entangled with the normative and subjective framing of the situation.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic moves from the internal domain of justification to the external domain of reliability. Initially, the 'Founding Insight' of reliabilism suggests that knowledge can be naturalized by reducing it to the reliability of belief-forming mechanisms, akin to objective probabilities in physics. This represents a compressive move: attempting to ground the normative status of knowledge in the objective status of statistical likelihood. However, the analysis reveals a rupture within this objective ground. The 'Reference Class Problem' demonstrates that there is no single, purely objective probability for any given event; probability exists only relative to a reference class, the selection of which depends on subjective explanatory interests. The 'Barn Facade' example serves as the concrete universal that crystallizes this tension: the subject has internal justification and a causal link to the object, yet lacks knowledge because the broader environment (the 999 facades) renders the belief cognitively fragile. This implies that 'Reliability' is not a brute physical fact but a complex relation between the mechanism, the environment, and the normative scope (reference class) used to evaluate it.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk is pivotal for dismantling 'Naive Naturalism.' It uses the tools of analytic epistemology (Goldman, Barn Facades) to serve the text's broader pragmatist argument. By showing that even 'objective probability' relies on a 'subjective' cut (the reference class), the text prepares the ground for a Hegelian-style synthesis where the Subject's interpretive activity is shown to be constitutive of the Object's determinate nature. The 'Barn Facade' case acts as a negation of both internalism (reasons aren't enough) and simple causal theories (causation isn't enough), pushing the system toward a social-perspectival definition of knowledge."

Crucially, the text reinterprets 'Truth' not as a metaphysical property, but as the social act of undertaking a commitment oneself that one has attributed to another. Finally, it suggests that the representational dimension of language (what we are talking *about*) emerges from the social difference in perspective between the producer and consumer of reasons.",

Having established that Knowledge requires a normative structure, the text now unpacks the internal mechanics of that structure. \n\nFirst, it bifurcates the normative flow: **Communication** is defined expansively as the *interpersonal* inheritance of entitlement (Subject A authorizes Subject B), while **Justification** is defined compressively as the *intrapersonal* redemption of entitlement (Subject A demonstrates consistency to Subject B). \n\nSecond, it sublates the concept of **Representation**. Rather than assuming representation is a primitive relation between word and world, the analysis reveals it as a social artifact arising from the need to bridge different doxastic perspectives. The problem of 'Holism' (where different beliefs imply different meanings) is resolved not by retreating to atomistic Reference, but by understanding Reference as the social capacity to navigate these differences.\n\nFinally, the concept of **Truth** undergoes a radical transformation.

        "summary": "This section provides an 'expressive deduction' of the necessity of singular terms and predicates within a language. Brandom argues that the existence of singular terms is not a reflection of pre-existing metaphysical objects, but a structural requirement for a language that is both learnable (projectible) and capable of logical self-reflection. Specifically, the introduction of logical vocabulary like conditionals—which allow implicit practices to be made explicit and debated—imposes structural constraints on the language. Because conditionals invert inferential roles (antecedents), the subsentential units substituted into them must possess 'symmetric significance' (identity) to remain stable. Thus, singular terms are born from the need to talk about our reasoning. Consequently, the structure of the objective world (objects and properties) is revealed as a derivative shadow cast by the necessary structure of our normative discursive practices.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The movement here represents the *definitive sublation of the Object*. Previously, the Object stood as an external target or resistance. Now, the text executes the 'Kant-Frege strategy' in reverse: rather than explaining language by appeal to objects, it explains objects by appeal to the necessary structure of language.\n\nThe deduction proceeds through a 'dual expressive necessity.' First, for a language to be learnable (projectible) beyond a finite set of sentences, it must be decomposable into subsentential parts (substitution). Second, for a language to be *rational* (capable of Socratic self-critique), it must contain logical vocabulary (conditionals and negation) that makes implicit inference rules explicit.\n\nThe crux of the argument is that these two demands interact violently. The logical conditional functions by *inverting* the inferential polarity of its antecedent (e.g., 'If P then Q'). This inversion destabilizes asymmetric inferential roles. Therefore, the basic units of substitution—singular terms—must possess *symmetric* substitution-inferential significance (identity, which is its own inverse) to survive embedding in logical locutions. \n\nThis yields a profound metaphysical conclusion: 'Why are there objects?' is answered by 'Because we need singular terms to make our reasoning explicit.' The 'well-lit discursive marketplace' of reason, where norms are debated, structurally necessitates a world of objects. Subjective practice, forced to become explicit, necessitates a specific objective ontology.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk is crucial because it derives Ontology from Pragmatics via Logic. The 'Expressive Deduction' is the mechanism. The 'Discursive Marketplace' is the normative realm where mere habit (s) is raised to rational law (n). The quote 'The limits of language... means the limits of my world' is interpreted not as a limitation, but as a definition of the World (o) as that which is intelligible through the structure of the Concept (n)."

        "summary": "This section establishes the priority of inference over truth, differentiates sapience from mere reliable response, and introduces the social dimension as the bridge to representation. It argues that truth is not a primitive property that inference merely tracks, but is functionally defined as that which is preserved by good inference. The distinction between a parrot (reliable responder) and a knower (concept user) is identified as the capacity to use responses as premises in reasoning. Finally, the text initiates a 'Kantian shift' from Cartesian certainty (subjective confidence) to normative necessity (bindingness), framing discursive practice as a social game of scorekeeping—tracking the commitments and entitlements that constitute meaning.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic advances by inverting the classical relationship between Truth and Inference. Rather than defining good inference as the preservation of a pre-existing Truth, the text defines Truth as the structural invariant of Good Inference (AX_TRUTH_AS_PRESERVATION). This firmly establishes the normative act of inferring as the primitive engine of the system.\n\nThis distinction is sharpened through the differentiation of the Knower from the mere Responder (the parrot or thermostat). While both possess reliable differential responsiveness (sentience), only the Knower possesses the 'practical know-how' to situate that response within a network of inferential relations (AX_INFERENTIAL_DEMARCATION_REDUX). The response becomes a *reason* only when it is conceptually articulated.\n\nThe narrative then pivots to the 'Social Route.' To explain how these inferential articulations achieve objective Reference (Representation), the analysis introduces Social Articulation. Representation is posited as the product of Inference combined with Social Practice (AX_SOCIAL_GENESIS). This leads to a profound redefinition of intentionality: shifting from Descartes' epistemological focus on Certainty (mental accessibility) to Kant's normative focus on Necessity (rule-governed responsibility) (AX_KANTIAN_SHIFT). Understanding is thus re-conceived not as an internal state, but as the social mastery of 'keeping score' on commitments and entitlements (AX_DISCURSIVE_SCOREKEEPING).",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk is critical for the transition from individual rationality to social objectivity. Brandom explicitly connects the 'inferential' to the 'social' to derive the 'representational.' The critique of the parrot/thermostat is a classic Brandomian move to distinguish the space of causes from the space of reasons. The introduction of 'Scorekeeping' here is the first explicit mention of the specific mechanism of social normativity."

        "summary": "This section initiates the derivation of objective representational content from social inferential practices. Brandom argues that 'representation' (talking about objects) is not a primitive relation but a complex social achievement derived from the game of giving and asking for reasons. He distinguishes between two forms of commitment: 'acknowledged' commitments (what one thinks one believes) and 'consequential' commitments (what strictly follows from one's claims, regardless of awareness). He then introduces 'ascriptional locutions' (saying 'S believes that...') as the explicitating vocabulary that codifies these social stances. Finally, he creates a crucial distinction between 'de dicto' ascriptions (attributing a commitment in the believer's own terms) and 'de re' ascriptions (specifying the object of belief in the ascriber's terms), identifying the latter as the mechanism that separates subjective perspective from objective reference.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic moves from the internal consistency of the Subject's assertions to the external rigidity of Normative Consequence. Initially, a Subject merely 'acknowledges' a belief (Thesis). However, the Normative structure of the concept expands this acknowledgement into a 'consequential commitment'—implications the Subject may not realize they hold, but are bound to 'willy-nilly' by the rules of inference (Antithesis). \n\nThis tension between what I think I believe and what I am actually committed to necessitates a social mechanism for management: Ascription. The text argues that we must replace the psychological concept of 'Belief' with the normative concept of 'Commitment.' \n\nThe synthesis of these positions appears in the distinction between *de dicto* and *de re* ascription. In a *de dicto* ascription, we merely report the Subject's internal perspective. In a *de re* ascription ('S claims *of* t that...'), the Asciber intervenes, using their own vocabulary to specify the object while attributing the predication to the Subject. This creates a complex normative structure where the 'responsibility' for the claim is divided: the Subject is responsible for the predicate, but the Asciber undertakes responsibility for the reference. This structural division of labor is the genesis of Objectivity—it is how we socially distinguish 'what is said' from 'what is true.'",
        "interpretive_notes": "Brandom explicitly rejects 'belief' as a primary explanatory category ('I do not officially believe in beliefs'), replacing it with 'commitment' to capture the normative/consequential force that exceeds psychological states. The 'De Re' mechanism is interpreted here not just as a linguistic quirk, but as the 'Polarized' moment where the Subjective (attributed) and Objective (undertaken) perspectives are simultaneously held in a single compressive judgment."

Brandom argues that representational vocabulary (words like 'of' and 'about') is grounded in the use of 'de re' ascriptions of propositional attitudes. By distinguishing between 'de dicto' (ascribing belief in a sentence) and 'de re' (ascribing belief about an object), he shows that representation is not a static metaphysical relation but a dynamic social function. The 'de re' locution allows an ascriber to substitute their own vocabulary for the believer's, thereby expressing a difference in social perspective. This substitution is the mechanism that generates objective content from subjective practice.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic advances from the internal coherence of the Subject's assertions to the external validity of those assertions regarding an Object. Previously, we established that truth is a normative status derived from assertion. Now, the text asks: How does thought reach out to the world? The answer lies in the distinction between *de dicto* and *de re*. \n\nIn the *de dicto* mode ('believing that'), the ascriber remains trapped within the believer's subjective scope—this is a compressive state where the content is limited to exactly what the subject acknowledges. However, the system necessitates an expansion toward the Object. This is achieved through the *de re* mode ('believing of'), where the ascriber steps outside the believer's scope and substitutes their own terms (e.g., substituting 'Benjamin Franklin' for 'the inventor of the lightning rod'). \n\nThis move—exporting a term from the subjective scope of the believer into the objective scope of the world (as managed by the ascriber)—is the genesis of 'representation.' Thus, objectivity is not a 'view from nowhere' but the result of coordinating disparate social perspectives through the expansive mechanism of *de re* ascription.",
        "interpretive_notes": "Brandom interprets the classic Quinean distinction between opaque (de dicto) and transparent (de re) contexts not as a logical puzzle, but as a social tool. 'Transparency' is re-read as the license to substitute terms based on the ascriber's auxiliary hypotheses. This aligns with the global PML arc: the 'Subject' (believer) is sublated by the 'Object' (what the belief is about) only through the mediation of the 'Normative' (the social practice of ascribing). Note the rejection of 'epistemically strong' de re (direct acquaintance) in favor of a pragmatic, substitutional de re."

The analysis culminates in the distinction between 'de dicto' and 'de re' ascriptions, showing that 'de re' ascriptions are the mechanism by which the social divergence of perspectives generates the objective structure of representation.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic advances by problematizing the immediacy of 'Belief.' The text deconstructs Belief into two distinct normative components: 'Acknowledgment' (what the Subject explicitly avows) and 'Consequential Commitment' (what the Normative structure entails, regardless of the Subject's awareness). This splits the Subject's internal state from their objective normative burden.\n\nThe narrative then introduces 'Ascription' as the explicitating tool for these statuses. Here, the crucial synthesis occurs through the distinction between 'de dicto' and 'de re' styles of ascription. A 'de dicto' ascription remains within the Subject's own horizon (what they acknowledge). A 'de re' ascription, however, introduces a second Subject (the Ascripter/Scorekeeper) who substitutes their own terms to specify what the first Subject is talking *about*.\n\nThis creates a 'Social Route to Representation.' Objectivity—talking *about* a specific object like a 'pathological liar'—is not a property of the mental state alone but emerges from the 'Division of Responsibility' between the Speaker (who attributes the predicate) and the Ascripter (who undertakes the reference). Thus, the 'Thing-in-itself' is revealed to be a social-perspectival construct generated by the friction between differing normative commitments.",

The author argues that 'claimable contents' become 'representational contents' through the mechanism of social scorekeeping. A critical distinction is drawn between 'belief' (a psychological state, which the author largely discards) and 'commitment' (a normative status). Commitments function in two modes: those 'acknowledged' (avowed or acted upon) and those undertaken 'consequentially' (logical implications, regardless of awareness). The text culminates in an analysis of 'ascription'—the explicit statement of another's commitment. This introduces the distinction between 'de dicto' ascription (where the target is responsible for the description) and 'de re' ascription (where the ascriber undertakes responsibility for the description, as seen in the 'sly prosecutor' example). This mechanism explains how we can talk *about* the same object despite differing beliefs.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic advances from the internal coherence of *Inference* to the external validity of *Representation*. Previously, the system established that concepts are nodes in an inferential network. Now, the system faces the problem of *reference*: how does this internal networking hook onto the world? \n\nThe solution is found not in a causal spark, but in the complex social normative structure of *Ascription*. The subject is replaced by the 'Scorekeeper'. We see the sublation of the psychological concept of 'Belief' into the rigorous normative concept of 'Commitment'. Belief is ambiguous; Commitment has a precise dual structure: the *Subjective* act of acknowledgment and the *Objective* weight of consequence. \n\nThis duality forces a split in how we describe thoughts. When we ascribe a commitment to another, we must navigate two perspectives: the perspective of the one thinking (De Dicto) and the perspective of the one ascribing (De Re). The 'De Re' ascription is revealed as the normative technology that allows the system to distinguish *what is said* from *what is talked about*, thereby generating Objectivity out of intersubjective social friction.",
        "interpretive_notes": "The 'Sly Prosecutor' example is pivotal. It demonstrates that *De Re* ascriptions ('The defense attorney claims of a pathological liar...') are not descriptions of a special kind of mental state, but are tools for partitioning normative responsibility. The ascriber takes responsibility for the term 'pathological liar,' while attributing the predicate 'trustworthy' to the attorney. This partition is the genesis of the 'Object' in the social deontic game—the Object is that which serves as the stable focal point (the 'it') across differing descriptions."

We began with the assertion that Semantics is rooted in Pragmatics. Now, we refine this: the capacity to represent objects (to have a world) is not a primitive relation between a mind and a thing, but a complex social achievement derived from the normative structure of 'scorekeeping.'\n\nThe text moves immediately to sublate the psychological concept of 'Belief' into the normative concept of 'Commitment.' Belief is private and opaque; Commitment is public and transparent. This necessitates a split in the subject: there is the commitment one *acknowledges* (avows), and the commitment one possesses *consequentially* (the logical implications of one's claims, whether recognized or not). This 'willy-nilly' consequentiality marks the intrusion of objective necessity into subjective freedom.\n\nThe climax of this movement is the derivation of Representation via 'De Re Ascription.' How do we talk *about* the same object if our beliefs differ? The answer lies in the 'sly prosecutor' who distinguishes between what is *attributed* to the target and what is *undertaken* by the ascriber. By saying 'He claims *of* the liar that he is trustworthy,' the ascriber substitutes their own term ('liar') to fix the reference, while attributing the predicate ('trustworthy') to the other. This perspectival triangulation—binding the other's subjective claim to the ascriber's objective commitment—is the 'social route' to Objectivity.",

The text argues that 'representation' is not a primitive link between word and world, but a social achievement generated by the interplay of two perspectives: the person who speaks (the target) and the person who interprets (the ascriber). This manifests in the distinction between 'de dicto' ascriptions (reporting what the speaker acknowledges) and 'de re' ascriptions (specifying what the speaker is actually talking about from the ascriber's point of view).",
        "conceptual_narrative": "We have previously established that conceptual content is inferential. Now, we face the 'Large Task': how does talking *to* each other turn into talking *about* objects? \n\nThe analysis begins by deconstructing the psychological concept of 'Belief' into the normative concept of 'Commitment.' This reveals a split: there are commitments we 'acknowledge' (Subjective/De Dicto) and commitments we incur 'consequentially' (Objective/Logical). \n\nThe crucial move is the 'Division of Responsibility.' When I ascribe a claim to you, I can restrict myself to your vocabulary (De Dicto), or I can substitute my own vocabulary to specify what you are really talking about (De Re). For example, the Prosecutor claims the Defense Attorney believes *of* a pathological liar that he is trustworthy. \n\nThis structure—holding the Subject responsible for the commitment while the Object (via the Ascriber) supplies the reference—is the mechanism that generates 'Representation.' Objectivity is not found in the void; it is found in the divergence between what is acknowledged by the self and what is attributed by the other.",

The 'De Re/De Dicto' distinction is reinterpreted not as types of belief, but as styles of ascription that negotiate the 'perspective gap' between Subject and Other. This gap is the birthplace of objective reference."

It begins by distinguishing two forms of commitment: 'acknowledged' commitments (what a subject explicitly avows or acts upon) and 'consequential' commitments (what logically follows from those avowals, regardless of the subject's awareness). This necessitates a shift from the psychological concept of 'belief' to the normative concept of 'commitment.' The text then introduces the mechanism of 'ascription' as the explicit form of the practical attitude of 'attributing' commitments. The analysis culminates in the structural distinction between 'de dicto' and 'de re' ascriptions. The author argues that 'de re' ascriptions (claiming of x that it is phi) are not a distinct type of belief, but a specific social achievement where the ascriber distributes responsibility: the ascriber undertakes the commitment to the singular term (the reference), while attributing the commitment to the predicate to the target. This social division of labor is what allows the 'object' to emerge from the conversation.",

It creates a space between what I think I am saying and what I am actually committed to. This space is inhabited by the social practice of 'Ascription.' When we ascribe a commitment to another, we make explicit the scorekeeping attitude that was previously implicit.\n\nThe crucial dialectical move is the derivation of 'Objectivity' from 'Inter-subjectivity' via the 'De Re' ascription. In a 'De Dicto' ascription ('He claims that...'), the ascriber mimics the target's perspective. But in a 'De Re' ascription ('He claims of the liar that...'), the ascriber steps in to substitute their own terms for the target's, bridging two perspectives. The 'Object' is thus revealed not as a pre-existing lump, but as the structural point of intersection between the commitment attributed to the other and the commitment undertaken by the self. Representation is the compressive unity of these divergent social perspectives.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk contains the famous 'I do not officially believe in beliefs' line, signaling a hard normative turn away from psychologism. The distinction between 'acknowledged' and 'consequential' commitments mirrors the earlier distinction between 'attitude' and 'status.' The 'De Re' analysis is the mechanism that explains how the 'Object' (AX_TOTALITY) is concretely realized through social triangulation (AX_OMEGA). It updates the global context by showing that 'Representation' is a social-perspectival achievement, not a metaphysical primitive."

Brandom argues that 'talking about objects' (representation) is derived from the social practice of giving and asking for reasons (inference), rather than being a primitive relation. He systematically sublates the psychological concept of 'Belief' into the normative concept of 'Commitment,' bifurcating the latter into 'acknowledged' commitments (what the subject avows) and 'consequential' commitments (what follows logically, willy-nilly). Finally, he introduces the distinction between 'de dicto' and 'de re' ascriptions not as types of belief, but as methods of scorekeeping that distinguish between the commitments attributed to a target and the commitments undertaken by the ascriber, thereby securing the objective reference of claims.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The movement here is a decisive shift from the Cartesian 'I' of private belief to the Social 'We' of normative scorekeeping. We begin by dismantling the 'ambiguous' concept of Belief. In its place, we install the rigorous concept of Commitment. This splits the subject: there is the Subject-for-Itself (Acknowledged Commitment) and the Subject-in-the-System (Consequential Commitment). The latter binds the subject to implications they may not foresee, creating a 'compressive necessity' that transcends private intent. \n\nThe mechanism of this transcendence is the *De Re* ascription. When an ascriber says, 'S claims *of* t that...', they are essentially running a substitution protocol: they attribute the belief-state to S, but they substitute their own commitment regarding 't' (the object) to ground the claim in reality. This dialectical maneuver is the birth of Objectivity within the intersubjective space; it is how the 'Thing-in-Itself' is grasped not by exiting language, but by triangulating perspectives within it.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk is critical for establishing the 'Social Route' to representation. Note the explicit rejection of 'Belief' in favor of 'Commitment' (axiom AX_COMMITMENT_DUALISM). This mirrors the shift from 'Sentience' to 'Sapience' earlier, but now refines Sapience into a structure of responsibility. The 'Prosecutor' example demonstrates that Objectivity is not a view from nowhere, but a specific coordination of the Ascriber's and Target's commitments (AX_DE_RE_SPLIT)."

        "summary": "This section concludes the analysis of representational locutions and initiates a new inquiry into the normative structure of objectivity. First, the text finalizes the distinction between De Dicto and De Re ascriptions through the example of action explanation: De Dicto ascriptions explain subjective attempts (what one is trying to do), while De Re ascriptions explain objective success (what actually happens). This confirms the thesis that representational content is the explicit expression of social differences in perspective (scorekeeping). The text then transitions to a new chapter, 'Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality,' establishing a 'Semantic Assertibilist' framework. This view grounds meaning in the proprieties of use (pragmatics) but immediately faces a critical challenge: distinguishing between the normative status of 'justification' (following the rules) and the normative status of 'truth' (objective correctness).",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The arc of the argument achieves a crucial closure before opening a new rift. We began by asking how the subjective 'I' connects to the objective 'World.' We found that this connection—representation—is not a direct ray but a social triangulation. The distinction between what you believe (De Dicto) and what is true (De Re) is revealed to be a mechanism for navigating the 'Social Perspectives' of interlocutors. Representation is thus sublated into Communication; 'Reference' is the shadow cast by the social necessity of reconciling different scorecards.\n\nHowever, this resolution generates a new, deeper tension. If meaning is grounded in social practice (Assertibilism), and social practice is defined by the rules of the game (Justification), how do we account for Objectivity? The text introduces the 'Dual Normativity' of assertion: we assess claims based on whether the speaker is *entitled* to make them (Justification) and whether they are *true* (Objective Correctness). The gap between these two—the fact that one can be justified but wrong—threatens the pragmatist project. If we only have access to our justifications, is Truth merely a fiction? The narrative thus moves from the *social constitution* of concepts to the *structural problem* of Objectivity within that social frame.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk is pivotal as it pivots from the 'Social Route' (Chapter 5) to the problem of 'Objectivity' (Chapter 6). Note the explicit alignment of 'Action Success' with 'Truth' and 'Action Attempt' with 'Justification.' This analogical reasoning reinforces the pragmatist thesis that theoretical structures are modeled on practical agency. The introduction of 'Semantic Assertibilism' sets the stage for the rest of the book: the goal is to derive a robust notion of objective Truth solely from the resources of assertibility (justification), resisting the urge to posit Truth as a primitive external relation."

        "summary": "This section bridges the gap between the social practice of reasoning and the objective capacity for representation. It argues that representational content (talking 'about' objects) is derived from the inferential articulation of claims within a social structure of scorekeeping. The analysis distinguishes between undertaking a commitment (subjective responsibility) and attributing one (intersubjective triangulation). Crucially, it replaces the psychological concept of 'belief' with the normative concept of 'commitment,' dividing the latter into acknowledged (avowed) and consequential (implied) forms. Finally, it introduces the distinction between 'de dicto' and 'de re' ascriptions not as kinds of mental states, but as distinct social styles of specifying content: 'de dicto' attributes the terms to the target, while 'de re' substitutes the ascriber's terms to specify the object, thereby rendering the distinction between subjective perspective and objective referent explicit.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "We have reached a pivotal moment in the dialectic where the 'Inferential' generates the 'Representational.' Previously, we established that concepts are nodes in an inferential network. Now, we ask: How does this internal network touch the external world? The answer lies not in a passive causal link, but in the active social friction of *Ascription*.\n\nThe text performs a critical sublation of 'Belief.' The psychological immediacy of believing is dissolved into the normative rigor of 'Commitment.' One does not merely have a belief; one *undertakes* a commitment, which then functions essentially as a license for others to *attribute* it. This creates a compressive necessity: we are committed 'willy-nilly' to the logical consequences of our claims, regardless of our subjective awareness. \n\nThe mechanism of objectivity is revealed through the logic of *De Re* ascription (e.g., 'He claims of the liar that he is trustworthy'). Here, the Asciber separates the *Object* (which the Asciber specifies) from the *Predication* (which the Target acknowledges). This split—between what is undertaken by the speaker and what is attributed to the target—constructs the 'perspective' necessary for objective representation. Objectivity is thus shown to be a social achievement, born from the triangulation of divergent perspectives within the game of giving and asking for reasons.",
        "interpretive_notes": "The rejection of 'belief' in favor of 'commitment' (specifically the distinction between acknowledged and consequential commitment) is a move from subjective psychology ($s(Sentience)$) to normative logic ($n(Status)$). The 'willy-nilly' consequential commitment represents the 'objectivity of the norm'—it binds the subject beyond their conscious intent. The De Re/De Dicto analysis is the technical apparatus that explains how intersubjectivity ($s(Self) \\leftrightarrow o(Other)$) generates objectivity ($o(Object)$) by allowing speakers to navigate the difference between 'what I say' and 'what I am talking about'."

        "summary": "This section elucidates the social route from reasoning to representation, demonstrating how the normative practice of inferential articulation generates objective representational content. It distinguishes between two forms of commitment: those explicitly acknowledged by a subject and those consequential commitments that follow logically, regardless of the subject's awareness. The analysis then moves to the mechanism of ascription, arguing that locutions like 'believes that' function to make implicit scorekeeping attitudes explicit. Finally, it introduces the distinction between 'de dicto' and 'de re' ascriptions not as different types of belief, but as different styles of assigning responsibility for conceptual content—separating what is attributed to the target from what is undertaken by the ascriber.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "We have reached a pivotal moment where the social mechanism of the 'game of giving and asking for reasons' begins to secrete the hard structure of objective representation. The text argues that we do not start with a relationship between word and world (representation) and then learn to reason; rather, we start with the social practice of inference, and through the complex triangulation of perspectives, the capacity to refer to objects emerges.\n\nThis emergence requires a rigorous distinction within the concept of Commitment. There is the subjective act of 'Acknowledgement' (what I take myself to be committed to) and the objective normative force of 'Consequence' (what my claims actually entail). This gap—between what one thinks one believes and what one is actually committed to by the logic of one's claims—is the space where Objectivity takes root. The subject is not the master of the meaning of their words; the normative logic of the concept is.\n\nTo navigate this, the system develops 'Explicitating Vocabulary.' Just as the conditional allows us to say what we previously only did in inference, ascriptional locutions (saying 'S believes that...') allow us to make our implicit scorekeeping attitudes explicit. \n\nThis culminates in the distinction between 'de dicto' and 'de re' ascriptions. This is not merely a grammatical nuance but the structural manifestation of the encounter between Self and Other. In a 'de dicto' ascription, we attribute the content entirely to the Other. In a 'de re' ascription (e.g., the prosecutor claiming the defense attorney believes *of a liar* that he is trustworthy), the Ascriber intervenes, mixing their own commitments (about the liar) with the attributed commitments of the Other. This 'Division of Responsibility' constitutes the concrete universal of social objectivity: truth emerges not from a single view, but from the friction and integration of divergent normative perspectives.",
        "interpretive_notes": "The 'Sly Prosecutor' example is the hermeneutic key here. It demonstrates that 'de re' ascription is the linguistic technology that allows us to map our view of the world onto another's view without collapsing the difference. This confirms that 'Objectivity' in this system is a social achievement involving the triangulation of perspectives (Ascriber, Target, Audience), rather than a solitary confrontation with nature. The move from 'Belief' (psychological) to 'Commitment' (normative) is finalized here."

        "summary": "This section serves as a synoptic conclusion, categorizing the project's stance as 'Strong Inferentialism'—distinct from both the insufficient 'Weak' variety and the excessive 'Hyper' variety. It explicitly defines the project's three fundamental architectural moves that transform a theory of assertibility into a theory of objective representation: (1) splitting undifferentiated assertibility into the normative statuses of commitment and entitlement, (2) expanding semantic explanation from mere circumstances of application to include inferential consequences, and (3) grounding these statuses in the social attitudes of attributing and acknowledging. This tripartite structure reveals how the 'social' (subjective attitudes) and the 'inferential' (normative roles) jointly constitute the 'representational' (objective content).",
        "conceptual_narrative": "As the inquiry reaches its structural terminus, the text reflects on the specific grade of inferentialism it has established. We have moved beyond 'Weak Inferentialism' (which merely admits inference is necessary) and avoided 'Hyperinferentialism' (which tries to reduce meaning to internal word-word moves, cutting off the world). Instead, we arrive at 'Strong Inferentialism,' where conceptual content is fully determined by 'broadly inferential' articulation—crucially including the material moves of entry (perception) and exit (action). \n\nThe mechanism for this achievement is retrospectively systematized into three dialectical steps. First, the singular concept of 'Assertibility' is sublated into the dual normative structure of Commitment and Entitlement, allowing for the definition of incompatibility. Second, the focus shifts from looking only at the input conditions (circumstances) to the output vectors (consequences), thereby defining content as a functional role in a network. Third, and most critically, normative status itself is revealed to be an abstraction from the concrete social attitudes of attributing and acknowledging. It is this final move—the shift to Social Perspective—that generates the structure of objectivity, as the difference between what I acknowledge and what I attribute to you opens the space for representation. Thus, the arc concludes: the Objectivity of the world is not a pre-given dogma but a social achievement of the concept.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk is methodologically vital as it provides the 'keys to the kingdom'—the explicit definitions of the three moves that structure the entire book. Note the explicit rejection of 'Hyperinferentialism,' which often confuses readers who mistake Brandom for a linguistic idealist. By insisting on 'Broad' inference (entry/exit moves), the text anchors the concept in the causal world without reducing it to causes. The 'Notes' section here acts as a meta-commentary, clarifying the difference between 'prima facie' entitlement and 'final' entitlement, a nuance that saves the system from circularity."

It concretizes the system's foundational distinctions and unifications: 'Sapience' is rigorously distinguished from 'Sentience' through the normative machinery of 'Semantics' and 'Social Practice.' The entry for 'Singular Terms' and 'Substitution' confirms the derivation of ontology from grammar: objects are shadows cast by the symmetric substitution-inferential roles (SMSICs) of singular terms. 'Truth' is de-reified, linked inexorably to the social act of 'Undertaking' a commitment. The arc concludes with 'Vocabulary' and 'Wittgenstein,' signaling the book's ultimate thesis: logical vocabulary is the organ of semantic self-consciousness, transforming implicit social practices into explicit, rational structures.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectical journey concludes by systematizing the vocabulary of reason itself. We began with the expansive immediacy of 'Sentience'—the mere differential response to stimuli. Throughout the text, this was sublated by the compressive necessity of 'Sapience,' which we now see is constituted entirely by 'Social Practices' of scorekeeping. \n\nThe mechanism of this constitution is revealed in the indexical cluster around 'Substitution.' Meaning is not attached to isolated 'Words' (Semantic Atomism is rejected) but emerges from 'Inference.' Specifically, the 'Singular Term'—and thus our reference to objective 'Reality'—is structurally derived from 'Simple Material Substitution-Inferential Commitments' (SMSICs). These are the invariants in our reasoning processes. \n\nFinally, 'Truth' is stripped of its metaphysical independence. It is revealed not as a property of the world in itself, but as a normative status within the game of 'Assertion' and 'Undertaking.' The system closes with the realization of 'Logical Expressivism': the function of logic is to make explicit the implicit rules of this game, allowing the rational agents to not only play but to understand and transform the rules themselves.",
        "interpretive_notes": "The Index entries for 'Sellars', 'Substitution', and 'Vocabulary' are particularly dense, serving as the skeletal structure of the book's argument. The specific mention of 'SMSICs' (Simple Material Substitution-Inferential Commitments) highlights the technical core of Brandom's derivation of object-representation from inferential propriety. The 'Socratic Method' entry reminds us that this entire project is a continuation of the Socratic drive to make the implicit explicit."

Crucially, the entry for 'Reasoning' explicitly directs us 'to representing,' encapsulating the entire project's vector: the move from the internal coherence of inference to the external validity of reference. We see 'Reliabilism' subordinated to 'Knowledge' but marked by the 'Naturalistic Blindspot,' preserving the critique that causal mechanisms are necessary but insufficient for sapience. The recursive structure of 'Logic' is presented not as a formal foundation, but as an expressive tool—a mirror that allows the practice to see itself.

This view is distinguished from 'Weak Inferentialism' (which merely holds that inference is necessary for content) and 'Hyperinferentialism' (which restricts content to internal linguistic moves). The text argues that conceptual content is sufficiently determined by 'broadly inferential articulation,' which includes not just language-language moves, but also the entry transitions of observation and the exit transitions of action. Finally, the author summarizes the three dialectical moves that structure the entire work: 1) distinguishing commitment and entitlement from undifferentiated assertibility to define incompatibility, 2) looking to consequences as well as circumstances to define inferential role, and 3) prioritizing social attitudes over normative statuses to secure objective representation.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The movement reaches its explicit self-definition. Having traversed the specific mechanics of language, we now categorize the theory itself. The Subjective Will of the system asserts itself as 'Strong Inferentialism.' This is a synthesis that avoids the abstract poverty of 'Hyperinferentialism' (which tries to act as if the world doesn't matter) and the timidity of 'Weak Inferentialism' (which clings to representationalism as primary). \n\nThe concept of 'Broad Inference' is the concrete universal here: it eats the world (observation and action) into the logical structure. The world is not outside the inference; the transition *from* the world to a claim (perception) and *from* a claim to the world (action) are themselves inferential moves. \n\nThe text also provides the 'Code' for the entire dialectic, retroactively illuminating the path: \n1. **differentiation**: Breaking 'assertibility' into 'commitment' and 'entitlement'.\n2. **Integration**: Uniting 'circumstances' and 'consequences' to create content.\n3. **Socialization**: Grounding 'status' in 'attitude' to generate objectivity. \n\nThis confirms that the Objectivity derived in previous chapters is not a pre-given fact, but a social achievement of the concept.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This is arguably the most important meta-theoretical chunk. It explicitly maps the logical space (Weak/Strong/Hyper) and provides the 'Three Moves' summary which essentially serves as the axiom-generation logic for the whole book. Brandom confirms here that 'Representation' is an effect of the 'Social Attitude' perspective, validating the 'AX_REPRESENTATIONAL_GENESIS' derived earlier."

The Index functions not merely as a navigational tool, but as the 'periodic table' of the discursive universe we have constructed. \n\nWe see the alpha and omega of the system: **Sapience** is re-asserted as the fundamental normative status, strictly discontinuous with mere **Sentience**. **Semantics** is finally codified not as a word-world relation, but as a function of **Social Practice** and **Inferentialism**. The structural mystery of how language hooks onto the world is resolved in the entry for **Singular Terms**, which are shown to be derived from the mechanism of **Substitution** within sentences.\n\nFinally, the concept of **Truth** is placed alongside **Vocabulary**, reinforcing the central thesis: that logical vocabulary exists to make explicit the implicit norms of truth and correctness that govern our discursive lives. The system is now closed; the implicit practice of reasoning has become an explicit theory of reasoning. The end (the Index) presupposes and contains the beginning (the concepts), realizing the structure as a self-determining whole.",

It catalogs the movement from 'Sapience' (the normative status of knowers) through 'Semantics' (inferential roles) to 'Social Practice' (the ground of normativity). The Index juxtaposes the subjective origins of meaning (Sentience, Social Articulation) with its objective products (Truth, Singular Terms), confirming the system's reliance on top-down semantic explanation and the expressive power of logical vocabulary.",

The dialectic reaches its 'Omega Point': the system reflects upon itself as a completed totality.\n\nWe see the final confrontation between **Sentience** (the biological substrate of reliable differential responsiveness) and **Sapience** (the normative status of being a reason-giver). The Index confirms that the bridge between them is not naturalistic reduction, but **Social Articulation**. The entries for 'Substitution' and 'Singular Terms' reiterate the mechanism of **Top-Down Explanation**: we do not build sentences from words like bricks; we carve words out of sentences through the analysis of substitution. \n\nThus, the arc of the book concludes. We began with the question of how thought hooks onto the world. We end with the realization that the 'World' (objective representational content) is the necessary shadow cast by the 'Practice' (normative social scorekeeping) when illuminated by 'Logic' (expressive vocabulary). The text itself now stands as an explicit logical expression of the implicit practices of rationality—a tool the reader must now pick up and use.",

Here, they appear synchronously, ordered not by the necessity of argument but by the contingency of the alphabet, yet inextricably linked by the numerical threads of page references. This marks the transition from the 'Doing' of the reading to the 'Structure' of the understood concept. The recurring distinction between 'Sapience' and 'Sentience', alongside the massive presence of 'Sellars' and the technical machinery of 'Substitution-inferential commitments', confirms the system's architecture: it is a structure where the implicit practice of reasoning is made explicit through the objective logic of vocabulary.

It traces the definitive relations between core concepts such as Sapience, Sentience, Substitution, and Truth. The index entries confirm the structural derivation of ontology (singular terms/objects) from grammar (substitution/sentences) and reaffirm the non-reducibility of normative Sapience to biological Sentience. It highlights the role of 'Semantic Self-Consciousness'—achieved through logical vocabulary—as the culmination of the discursive practice.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "In this final retrospective, the system turns its gaze back upon itself. The Index acts as the *Objectified Memory* of the dialectical journey. We see the final solidification of the distinction between **Sapience** (the normative space of reasons) and **Sentience** (the causal space of nature), a boundary that defines the human cognitive condition. The entries for **Singular Terms** and **Substitution** encapsulate the work's radical ontological thesis: that 'objects' are not primitive givens but are shadows cast by the grammar of our singular terms, which are themselves derived from the symmetric substitution of expressions within sentences. Finally, the recurrence of **Logical Vocabulary** and **Semantic Self-Consciousness** signals the completion of the arc. The implicit social practices of reasoning have been successfully explicated into a theoretical structure, allowing the system to become conscious of its own normative machinery. The 'Whole' is no longer an abstract horizon but a concrete, navigable network of inferential relations.",
        "interpretive_notes": "The Index entry for 'Sapience' (referencing pp. 157-158) bookends the text's central struggle against reductionism. The detailed breakdown under 'Singular terms'—linking them to 'substitution-structural roles' and 'objects'—provides textual confirmation that ontology is derived from syntax-semantics interface. The entry for 'Semantic self-consciousness' identifies the telos of the book: not just to use logic, but to understand logic as the organ of making implicit practice explicit."

The Index presents these not as becoming, but as *being*—fixed points in a network. This sublates the subjective time of the reader into the objective space of the System.\n\n2.  **The Explicit Web of Inference**: The cross-references (e.g., 'Semantics... See also Inference') materially demonstrate the axiom of *Inferential Holism*. No concept stands alone; each is defined by its pointer to another. The Index is the physical manifestation of the claim that conceptual content is relational.\n\n3.  **The Final Synthesis of Truth and Practice**: The entries for 'Truth' and 'Social Practices' are juxtaposed, reinforcing the Pragmatist thesis that objective truth is grounded in normative social articulation. The presence of 'Vocabulary' as a major category underscores the Expressivist thesis: the system is a tool for making explicit what was implicit in practice.\n\n4.  **Closure of the Hermeneutic Circle**: The journey began with the problem of sapience and ends with the entry for 'Sapience,' referencing the entire span of the text.

The narrative arc culminates in the rigorous definition of 'Semantics' not as a relationship between word and world, but as the 'substitution-inferential significance' generated within 'Social Practices.' The entry for 'Singular Terms' reveals the secret of ontology: objects are shadows cast by the grammar of substitution. The text ends by referencing 'Wittgenstein' and 'Wright,' acknowledging the pragmatic roots of this logical expressivism. This is the moment of 'Absolute Knowing' in the system—where the process of reasoning is frozen into a map of reasons, showing that the Subjective practice of inference and the Objective structure of meaning are one and the same Normative Reality.",

The heavy entries for 'Sellars' and 'Substitution' confirm the dual lineage of the work: the social-pragmatism of Sellars and the formal logic of substitution. The presence of 'SMSICs' (Simple Material Substitution-Inferential Commitments) as a key entry highlights the atomic unit of this semantic theory—the point where the world (Material) meets the logic (Substitution) within a normative status (Commitment)."

While formally a list of terms, philosophically it represents the 'frozen' structure of the argument, where the temporal unfolding of the book is collapsed into a spatial, accessible whole. It highlights the work's central pillars: the distinction between sapience and sentience, the grounding of semantics in social inference, the derivation of object-reference (singular terms) from substitutional roles, and the pragmatic analysis of truth and assertion. The Index reveals the system's closure; every concept is defined by its relation to the others, embodied in the cross-references.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "We arrive at the terminus of the dialectical journey. The 'Index' is not merely an appendage but the *Concept* fully realized as a self-referential system. Throughout the text, we moved from the immediate singularity of concepts (like 'Inference' or 'Representation') through their expansive conflicts and dialectical resolutions. Now, in the Index, these moments are presented in their 'mediated unity.' \n\nConsider the entry for **Sapience**: it is explicitly linked to *Assertion* and *Linguistic Practice*. This crystallizes the book's primary thesis: that to be a knower is not to possess a Cartesian inner light, but to be a player in a social game of reasoning. \n\nSimilarly, the dense cluster of entries around **Substitution** and **Singular Terms** recapitulates the derivation of ontology from logic. The world of objects is not a pre-given datum that stamps itself on the mind; rather, the structure of the 'object' is generated expansively by the subjective mechanism of substitution—treating distinct token events as playing the same role. \n\nFinally, the entries for **Truth** and **Vocabulary** reinforce the expressivist turn: truth is not a static property of correspondence, but a normative status (assertibility) emerging from social scorekeeping. The list ends, fittingly, by pointing back to the community of interlocutors (Sellars, Wittgenstein, Wright), affirming that the solitary act of reading is itself a social practice. The circle is closed: the specific arguments have been sublated into a totalizing network of references.",

The index stands as the externalized memory of the argument, freezing the dynamic movement of thought into a navigable spatial structure.",

Throughout the journey, we have traced the movement from implicit social practices to explicit logical codification. The index acts as the 'dead letter' that preserves the 'living spirit' of the argument. \n\nHere, the differentiation between 'Sentience' and 'Sapience' is archived as a fundamental discontinuity, reminding us that understanding is a normative status, not a biological state. The entries for 'Singular Terms' and 'Substitution' encapsulate the book's boldest ontological thesis: that the objects we talk about are shadows cast by the grammatical structure of our singular terms, specifically their symmetric substitution roles. \n\nMost crucially, the entry for 'Semantic Self-Consciousness' signals the system's closure. The logical vocabulary developed throughout the book allows the discursive practice to turn its gaze back upon itself. The 'Top-down' approach listed in the index affirms that the whole (the game of giving and asking for reasons) is prior to the parts (words and concepts). In this final moment, the linear temporal argument collapses into a simultaneous spatial totality, achieving the structure of the Concrete Universal.",
