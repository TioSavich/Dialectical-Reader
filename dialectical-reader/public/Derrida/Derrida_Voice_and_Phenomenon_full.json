Until the fourth edition (1928), there was no fundamental shift; nothing was put back into question in a decisive way. Some things were of course rearranged, and there   was   a   powerful   work   of   explanation.   Ideas   I   and   Formal   and Transcendental Logic   unfold, without a break, the concepts of intentional or noematic sense, the difference between the two strata of analytics in the broad sense (pure morphology of judgments and consequence-logic), and they remove the deductivist or nomological restriction that has until now affected the concept of science in general. [a] 1   The conceptual premises of the   Logical Investigations   are still at work in   The Crisis   and the texts associated with it, in particular in “The Origin of Geometry,” 2   notably when they concern all the problems of signi fi cation and of language in general. In this domain more than anywhere else, a patient reading would bring to light in the   Logical Investigations   the germinal structure of all of Husserl’s thought. On each page the necessity—or the implicit practice—of the eidetic   and   phenomenological   reductions   can   be   read,   the   detectable presence of all of that to which the reductions give access. Now the First Logical Investigation (“Ausdruck und Bedeutung”) [b] 3  <2> opens with a chapter devoted to the “essential distinctions” that rigorously order all the later analyses. And the coherence of this chapter owes everything to a distinction that is proposed in the   fi rst paragraph: the word “sign” ( Zeichen ) would have a “double sense” ( ein Doppelsinn ). 4   The sign “sign” can mean “expression” ( Ausdruck ) or “indication” ( Anzeichen ). 5  From what question shall we receive and read this distinction, whose stakes appear to be quite high? Before proposing this purely “phenomenological” distinction between the   two   senses   of   the   word   “sign”   or   rather   before   recognizing   the distinction, before raising it up into what intends to be a simple description, Husserl proceeds to a sort of implicit phenomenological reduction. He puts out of play all constituted knowledge. He insists on the necessary absence of   presuppositions   ( Voraussetzungslosigkeit ),   whether   they   come   from\n\nmetaphysics, from psychology, or from the natural sciences. The starting point in the “Faktum” of language is not a presupposition as long as we are attentive to the contingency of the example. The analyses thus carried out keep their “sense” and their “epistemological value”—their value in the order of the theory of knowledge ( erkenntnistheoretischen Wert )—whether languages exist or not, whether beings such as humans actually make use of languages or not, whether humans or a nature exist really or merely “in the imagination and on the basis of the mode of possibility.” 6  The most general form of our question is thus prescribed. Do not the phenomenological necessity, the rigor and the subtlety of <3> Husserl’s analysis, the demands to which it responds and the demands we must   fi rst of all satisfy, nevertheless dissimulate a metaphysical presupposition? Do they not hide a dogmatic or speculative attachment which would, certainly, not restrain the phenomenological critique from outside of itself, which would not be the residue of an unnoticed naïveté, but would   constitute  phenomenology from its inside, in its critical project and in the instituting value of its own premises? It would be restrained precisely in what phenomenology will recognize soon as the source and the guarantee of all value,   “the   principle   of   all   principles,”   namely,   the   originary   giving evidentness, the   present   or the   presence   of sense in a full and originary intuition. In other words, we are not wondering whether some sort of metaphysical heritage has been able, here or there, to limit the vigilance of a phenomenologist. Rather we are wondering whether the   phenomenological  form of this vigilance is not already ordered by metaphysics itself. In the lines that we just evoked, the mistrust in regard to the metaphysical presuppositions is given already as the condition of an authentic “theory of knowledge,” as if this project of a theory of knowledge, even when it has become independent from some such speculative system by means of a “critique,” does not belong, from the moment it starts up, to the history of metaphysics. Isn’t it the case that the idea of knowledge and a theory of knowledge are metaphysical in themselves? Therefore what would be at issue, on the basis of the privileged example of the sign, will be to see the phenomenological critique of metaphysics announce itself as a moment within the security that metaphysics provides. Better, what would be at issue will be to begin to verify that the resource of\n\nthe phenomenological critique is the metaphysical project itself, in its historical completion and in the purity of its origin albeit restored. We have attempted elsewhere to follow the movement by means <4> of which Husserl, by constantly criticizing metaphysical speculation, was truly aiming his critique only at the perversion or the degeneration of what he continues to think and to want to restore as authentic metaphysics or  philosophia prot ē . [c] 7   Concluding his   Cartesian Meditations,   Husserl still opposes authentic metaphysics (the one that will owe its achievement to phenomenology) to metaphysics in the usual sense. The results that he presents then are, he writes,  metaphysical, if it is true that ultimate knowledge of being should be called metaphysical. On the other hand, what we have here is anything but metaphysical in the usual sense: a historically degenerate metaphysics which by no means conforms to the spirit in which metaphysics as “ fi rst philosophy” was originally instituted. Phenomenology’s purely intuitive, concrete, and also apodictic mode of demonstration excludes all “metaphysical adventure,” all speculative excess. 8  One would be able to bring to light the single and permanent motive for all the mistakes and all the perversions that Husserl denounces in “degenerate” metaphysics, across a multiplicity of domains, themes, and arguments: it is always a blindness in the face of the authentic mode of   ideality,   of that which   is,   which can be   repeated   inde fi nitely in the   identity   of its   presence  because of the very fact that it   does not exist,   is not   reell,   is   irreell,   not in the sense of   fi ction, but in another sense which will be able to receive several names, whose possibility will allow us to speak of the non-reality and of the necessity of essence, of the noema, of the intelligible object and of non-mundanity in general. 9   This   non-mundanity,   not   being   another mundanity, this ideality not being an existent that comes down from the sky, will always have its origin in the possibility of the repetition of the act that produces it. So that the possibility of this repetition can be open   idealiter   to in fi nity, it is necessary that one ideal form secures this unity of the  inde fi nitely   and the   idealiter:   this is the present, or rather the presence of the  living present.   The ultimate form of ideality, the one in which in the last analysis we can anticipate or recall all <5> repetition, the ideality of ideality is the   living present,   the self-presence of transcendental life. Presence has always been and will always be, to in fi nity, the form in which—we can say this apodictically—the in fi nite diversity of contents will be produced. The\n\nopposition—the inaugural opposition of metaphysics—between form and matter,   fi nds in the concrete ideality of the living present its ultimate and radical justi fi cation. We shall come upon the enigma of the concept of   life   in the expressions “the living present” and “transcendental life” again. Let us note, however, in order to specify our intention here, that phenomenology appears to us to be tormented if not contested, from the inside, by means of its   own   descriptions   of   the   movement   of   temporalization   and   of   the constitution of intersubjectivity. At the greatest depth of what connects these two decisive moments of the description together, one sees an irreducible non-presence recognized as a constituting value, and with it a non-life or a non-presence of the living present, a non-belonging of the living present to itself, a non-originarity that cannot be eradicated. The names that it receives only make its resistance to the form of presence more vivid;   in two words,   what is at issue is: (1) the necessary passage from retention to   re-presentation   ( Vergegenwärtigung ) in the constitution of the presence of a temporal object ( Gegenstand ) whose identity can be repeated; (2) the necessary passage through   appresentation   in the relation to the   alter ego,   that is, in the relation to what also makes possible an ideal objectivity in general, intersubjectivity being the condition of objectivity and this objectivity being absolute only in the case of ideal objects. In the two cases, what is named as a modi fi cation of presentation ( re -presentation and   ap - presentation) ( Vergegenwärtigung   or   Appräsentation ) does not supervene upon presentation, but conditions it by   fi ssuring it   a priori.   That does not call into question the apodicticity of the phenomenological-transcendental description. It does not cut into the founding value of presence. This expression, moreover, “the founding value of presence,” is a pleonastic expression. What is at issue, however, is to make the original and non- empirical space of <6> non-foundation appear, as the irreducible emptiness from which the security of presence in the metaphysical form of ideality is decided and from which this security removes itself. It is within this horizon that we are here interrogating the phenomenological concept of the sign. The concept of metaphysics with which we are working will have to be determined, and the generality of this question, which is too large, must be narrowed here. In the case in point, we are narrowing down the question to this: how to justify   fi rst of all the   decision   which subordinates a re fl ection on the sign to a logic? And if the concept of sign precedes logical re fl ection,\n\nis given to logic, is delivered to its critique, from where does the concept of the sign come? Where does the essence of the sign, in relation to which this concept is regulated, come from? What grants authority to a theory of knowledge in order to determine the essence and origin of language? Such a  decision,   we do not attribute it to Husserl; he takes it up explicitly, or rather, he takes up explicitly its heritage and validity. The consequences of this are limitless. On the one hand, Husserl has had to defer, from one end of his itinerary to another, every explicit meditation on the essence of language   in general.   He puts the meditation on the essence of language in general “out of play” in   Formal and Transcendental Logic. 10   And, as Fink has indeed shown, Husserl never posed the question of the transcendental   logos,   of the inherited language in which phenomenology produces and exhibits the results of the workings of the reduction. The unity between ordinary language (or the language of traditional metaphysics) and the language of phenomenology is never broken despite all the precautions, quotation marks, renovations and innovations. The transformation of a traditional concept into an indicative or metaphorical concept does not absolve the heritage; it imposes questions which Husserl has never attempted to answer. This is due to the fact that, on the other hand, by being interested in language only within the horizon of rationality, by determining the   logos   on the basis of logic, Husserl has in fact, and in a traditional way, determined the essence of language by starting from logicity as the normalcy of its  telos.   What we would like to suggest here is that this   telos   <7> is the   telos  of being as presence. Thus, for example, when what is at issue is the rede fi nition of the relation between pure grammar and pure logic (a relation that traditional logic   would   have   missed,   since   it   was   perverted   by   metaphysical presuppositions), when what is at issue therefore is the constitution of a pure morphology of   Bedeutungen   (we are not translating this word for reasons   that   will   appear   in   a   moment),   the   re-apprehension   of   pure grammaticality, the system of rules that allow us to recognize whether a discourse in general is really a discourse—if it makes   sense   or if falsehood or   the   absurdity   of   contradiction   ( Widersinnigkeit )   do   not   make   it incomprehensible and do not deprive it of the quality of meaningful discourse, do not render it   sinnlos —then the pure generality of this meta- empirical grammar does not cover the whole   fi eld of the possibility of\n\nlanguage in general; it does not exhaust the whole extent of the   a priori   of language. The pure generality of the meta-empirical grammar concerns only the   logical a priori   of language; it is   pure logical grammar.   This restriction is functioning from the beginning, although Husserl did not stress it in the  fi rst edition of the   Logical Investigations:  In the First Edition, I spoke of “pure grammar,” a name conceived and explicitly devised as being analogous to Kant’s “pure science of nature.” But to the extent that it cannot, however, be asserted that the pure morphology of   Bedeutungen   takes in the entire grammatical   a priori   in its universality—since for example the communicative relations between psychical subjects, so important for the grammar, involve their own   a priori,   the expression “pure logical grammar” is preferable. 11  Carving out the logical   a priori   within the general   a priori   of language does not extract a region. As we are going to see, it designates the dignity of a   telos,   the purity of a norm, and the essence of a destination. <8> By locating in the First Logical Investigation the roots that Husserl’s later discourse will never disturb, we would like to show here therefore that the movement in which the whole of phenomenology is already engaged repeats the original intention of metaphysics itself. The value of   presence  (in the two connected senses of the proximity of what is set out as an object of an intuition and the proximity of the temporal present which gives its form to the clear and actual intuition of the object), the last court of appeal for this whole discourse, modi fi es itself, without its being lost, every time what is at issue is the presence of any object whatsoever to consciousness in the clear evidence of a ful fi lled intuition or when what is at issue is self- presence in consciousness—“consciousness” meaning nothing other than the possibility of the self-presence of the present in the living present. 12  Each time that this value of presence is threatened, Husserl will awaken it, will recall it, will make it return to itself in the form of the   telos,   that is, in the form of the Idea in the Kantian sense. There is no   ideality   unless an Idea in the Kantian sense is at work, opening the possibility of an inde fi nite, the in fi nity of a prescribed progress, or the in fi nity of permitted repetitions. This ideality is the very form in which the presence of an object in general can be inde fi nitely repeated as the   same.   The non-reality of the   Bedeutung,  the non-reality of the ideal object, the non-reality of the inclusion of the sense or of the noema in consciousness (Husserl will say that the noema does not belong in a reell manner— reell —to consciousness) will provide\n\ntherefore the security that the presence to consciousness will be able to be repeated   inde fi nitely:   ideal   presence   to   an   ideal   or   transcendental consciousness. Ideality is the salvation or the mastery of presence in repetition. In its purity, this presence is the presence of nothing that   exists   in the world; it is in correlation with acts of repetition which are themselves ideal. Is this to say that what opens the repetition to in fi nity or what is opened in repetition when the movement of idealization is secured   is   a certain   relation   of   an   “existent”   to   his   death?   Is   this   to   say   that “transcendental life” is the scene <9> of this relation? It is too early to say that. First, it is necessary to pass through the problem of language. We shall not be surprised to discover that language is really the medium of this play of presence and absence. Is it not in language, is not language   fi rst of all the very thing in which   life   and   ideality   could seem to be united? Now, we must consider   on the one hand   that the element of signi fi cation—or the substance of expression—which seems best to preserve at once ideality and living presence in all of its forms, is living speech, the spirituality of the breath as  phon ē .   On the other hand, we must consider that phenomenology, the metaphysics of presence in the form of ideality, is also a philosophy of   life.  It is a philosophy of life not only because, in its center, death is recognized as having nothing but an empirical and extrinsic signi fi cation, the signi fi cation of mundane accident, but also because the source of sense in general is always determined as the act of a thing that   lives,   as the act of a living being, as   Lebendigkeit.   Now the unity of living, the hearth   fi re of the   Lebendigkeit   which diffracts its light into all the fundamental concepts of phenomenology ( Leben, Erlebnis, lebendige Gegenwart, Geistigkeit,  etc.), escapes the transcendental reduction, and as the unity of mundane life and transcendental life, blazes open even the passage for the reduction. 13  When empirical life or even the pure region of the psychical are bracketed, what Husserl discovers is still a transcendental   life   or in the last analysis the transcendentality of a   living   present—and Husserl thematizes it without so much   as   posing   the   question   of   this   unity   of   the   concept   of   life.  “Consciousness without a soul” ( seelenloses ), whose essential possibility is presented in   Ideas I   (§54), is still a   living   transcendental consciousness. If we conclude, with a gesture that is in fact very Husserlian in its style, that the   concepts   of   empirical   life   (or   in   general   mundane   life)   and\n\ntranscendental life are radically heterogeneous and that a purely indicative or metaphorical relation is going on between the two names, then the possibility of this <10> relation bears the entire weight of the question. The common root that makes all of these metaphors possible appears to us to still be the concept of   life.   In the last analysis, between the pure psychical— a region of the world that is opposed to transcendental consciousness and is discovered   by   means   of   the   reduction   of   the   totality   of   the   natural, transcendent world—and the pure transcendental life, there is, Husserl says, a relation of   parallelism.  Phenomenological psychology will in fact have to remind any working psychology of its background of eidetic presuppositions and the conditions of its own language. It will be incumbent on phenomenological psychology to settle the sense of the concepts of psychology, and   fi rst of all the sense of what we call the   psych ē .   But what is going to allow us to distinguish this phenomenological psychology, which is an eidetic and   a priori,   descriptive science, from transcendental phenomenology itself? What is going to allow us to distinguish the epoch ē   which discovers the immanent domain of the purely psychical from the transcendental epoch ē   itself? For the   fi eld opened by this pure psychology has a privilege in regard to the other regions, and its generality dominates all other regions. All lived-experiences arise from it necessarily and the sense of every region or of every determinate object is announced by way of this pure psychology. Thus too the dependence of the purely psychical in regard to transcendental consciousness, which is the archi-region, is absolutely singular. The domain of pure psychological experience in fact coincides with the totality of the domain of what Husserl calls transcendental experience. And yet, despite this perfect   coincidence,   a radical difference remains, which has nothing in common with any other difference. This is a difference which in fact distinguishes nothing, a difference which separates no being, no lived-experience, no determinate signi fi cation. This is a difference however which, without altering anything, changes all the signs, and it is a difference in which alone the possibility of a transcendental question holds, that is, the possibility of freedom itself. This is, therefore, the fundamental difference without which no other difference in the world would make sense or even have a chance of appearing   as such.   Without the possibility and without the <11> recognition\n\nof such a   doubling   ( Verdoppelung ), whose rigor will tolerate no duplicity, without this invisible distance stretched between the two acts of the epoch ē , transcendental   phenomenology   would   be   destroyed   at   its   root.   The dif fi culty   is   based   on   the   fact   that   this   doubling   of   sense   must   not correspond to any ontological double. For example, and brie fl y put, my transcendental I 14   is radically different, Husserl explicitly states, from my natural and human I. 15   And yet, the transcendental I is distinguished from the natural and human I by nothing, by nothing that might be determined by the natural sense of distinction. The (transcendental) I is not an other. It is especially not the metaphysical or formal phantom of the empirical self. 16  This is what would lead to denouncing the idea that the absolute spectator I is the theoretical image and metaphor of its literal psychical self; as well this means denouncing every analogical language of which we must at times make use in order to announce the transcendental reduction and in order to describe this unheard-of “object” which is the psychical self over against the absolute transcendental ego. Truly, no language is equal to this operation by which the transcendental ego constitutes and opposes its own mundane   self,   that   is,   opposes   its   soul,   by   re fl ecting   itself   in   a  verweltlichende Selbstapperzeption. [d] 17   The pure soul is this strange self- objectivation ( Selbstobjektivierung ) of the monad by and in itself. [e] 18   There also the Soul proceeds from the One (the monadic ego) and can freely turn itself back toward the monadic ego in a Reduction. All of these dif fi culties are concentrated in the enigmatic concept of “parallelism.” Husserl evokes the astonishing, admirable “parallel nature” and even “the coincidence, if we may put it this way,” of phenomenological psychology and transcendental phenomenology, “both understood as eidetic disciplines.” [f]   “The one <12> inhabits the other, so to speak, implicitly.” This   nothing   that distinguishes the parallels, this nothing without which no explication, that is, no language, would be able to develop freely in the truth without being distorted by some real milieu, this nothing without which no transcendental, that is, philosophical, question would be able to take a breath, this nothing arises, if we can say this, when the   totality   of the world is   neutralized   in   its   existence   and   reduced   to   its   phenomenon.   This operation is that of the transcendental reduction; in any case, it cannot be that   of   the   psycho-phenomenological   reduction.   The   pure   eidetics   of\n\npsychical   lived-experience   concerns,   undoubtedly,   no   determinate existence,   no   empirical   factuality;   it   calls   for   no   signi fi cation   that   is transcendent to consciousness. But the essences that it settles   intrinsically  presuppose the existence of the world in that kind of mundane region called the   psych ē .   Moreover, we must notice that this parallelism does more than release the transcendental ether. What it does is make more mysterious still (and it alone is capable of doing this) the sense of the   psychical   and of psychical   life,   that is, it makes more mysterious the sense of a   mundanity  that is capable of bearing and in some way nurturing   transcendentality,  having a domain equal in extent to transcendentality without, however, merging with the transcendental in some total   adequation.   To conclude from this   parallelism   with an   adequation   is the most tempting, the most subtle   but   also   the   most   obscuring   of   confusions:   transcendental psychologism.   Against this, it is necessary to maintain the precarious and threatened   distance   between   the   parallels;   against   transcendental psychologism   it   is   necessary   to   question   constantly.   Now,   since transcendental consciousness is not impaired in its sense by the hypothesis of a destruction of the world ( Ideas I,   §49), “it is certain that we can think a consciousness without a body and, as paradoxical as it may seem, without a soul [ seelenloses ].” 19   And yet, transcendental consciousness   is nothing more or   other   than   psychological   consciousness.   Transcendental   <13> psychologism does not understand that. It does not understand that if the world needs a   supplement of soul,   the soul, which is in the world, needs this  supplementary nothing   that is the transcendental and without which no world would appear. If we are attentive to Husserl’s renewal of the notion of the “transcendental,” then we must do the opposite of transcendental psychologism and guard against endowing this distance with some sort of reality. We must not substantialize this inconsistency or turn it into, perhaps by simple analogy, some thing or some factor of the world. This would be to freeze the light at its source. If language never escapes from analogy, even if it is analogy through and through, it must, having reached this point, and at this very point, freely take up its own destruction and cast metaphors against metaphors. This is to obey the most traditional of imperatives, an imperative that has received its most explicit (but not the most original) form in the   Enneads,   an imperative that has never stopped being faithfully\n\ntransmitted all the way down to the   Introduction to Metaphysics   (especially that of Bergson). This war of language against itself is the price that we have to pay in order to think sense and the question of the origin of sense. We see that this war is not one war among many. As a polemic for the possibility of sense and of the world, this war takes place in this   difference,  which, as we have seen, cannot inhabit the world, but only language, in its transcendental restlessness. In truth, far from merely inhabiting language, this difference is also its origin and its abode. Language keeps watch over the difference that keeps watch over language. Later, in his   Nachwort zu meinen Ideen   (1930) and in the   Cartesian Meditations   (§14 and 57), Husserl will evoke again, and brie fl y, this “precise parallelism” between “the pure psychology of consciousness” and “the transcendental phenomenology of consciousness.” 20   And he will then say, in order to impugn transcendental psychologism which “makes an authentic philosophy impossible” ( Cartesian Meditations,   §14), we have to practice at all costs the “Nuancierung” which distinguishes the parallels, one of which is in the world and the other is outside of the world without being in another world, that is, without stopping <14> to be,   like every parallel, alongside   and   right next to the other. 21   At all costs, it is necessary to   collect   and   shelter   in   our   discourse   these   subtle   ( geringfügigen ), frivolous, “seemingly trivial nuances” that “decisively decide the paths and the detours [ Wege und Abwege ] of philosophy” ( Cartesian Meditations,  §14). Our discourse must shelter these nuances within itself and at once thereby   in them re-secure its possibility and its rigor.   But the strange unity of these two parallels, what relates the one to the other, does not let itself be distributed   by   the   parallels,   and   by   dividing   itself   fi nally   welds   the transcendental to its other: this strange unity is   life.   One sees in fact very quickly that the sole kernel of the concept of   psych ē   is life as self-relation, whether the relation is produced or not in the form of consciousness. “Living” is therefore the name of what precedes the reduction and escapes  fi nally from all the distributions that the reduction brings to light. Life, however, is its own distribution and its own opposition to its other. By determining “living” in this way, we just therefore named the resource of the insecurity of discourse, the point at which precisely it can no longer   re- secure its possibility and its rigor in the nuance.   This concept of life is then\n\ngrasped in an agency which is no longer that of pre-transcendental naïveté, in the language of everyday life or in the language of biological science. But if this ultra-transcendental concept of life allows us to think life (in the everyday sense or in the sense of biology) and if it has never been inscribed in any language, this concept of life perhaps calls for   another name.  We will be less astonished confronting the effort of phenomenology—an effort that is laborious and oblique, even tenacious—to keep watch over speech, in order to assert an essential link between the   logos   and the   phon ē ,  since the privilege of consciousness (about which Husserl fundamentally never   wondered   what   consciousness   is,   despite   all   the   admirable, interminable and in many regards revolutionary meditations that he devoted to it) is only the possibility of the living voice. Since self-consciousness appears only in its relation to an object whose presence it can keep watch over and repeat, self-consciousness is never perfectly foreign or prior to the possibility of language. As we shall see, Husserl <15> doubtlessly wanted to maintain an originarily silent, “pre-expressive” layer of lived-experience. But since the possibility of constituting ideal objects belongs to the essence of consciousness, and since these ideal objects are historical products, which appear only thanks to acts of creation or of intention, the element of consciousness and the element of language will be more and more dif fi cult to discern. Now, is it not the case that their indiscernability will introduce non-presence and difference (mediacy, the sign, referral, etc.) right into the heart of self-presence? This dif fi culty   calls for   a response. This response is called the voice. The enigma of the voice is rich and profound because of all the things to which it seems to be responding. That the voice simulates the “keeping watch” over presence and that the history of spoken language is the archive of this simulation from now on prevents us from considering the “dif fi culty” to which the voice responds, in Husserl’s phenomenology, either as a systematic dif fi culty or as a contradiction that would be speci fi c to his phenomenology. That as well prevents us from describing this simulation, whose structure involves an in fi nite complexity, as an illusion, a phantasm, or a hallucination. These last concepts in fact refer to the simulation of language as to their common root. This “dif fi culty” structures Husserl’s whole discourse, and we must recognize the work it does. By exploiting all of its resources with the\n\ngreatest critical re fi nement, Husserl will radicalize the necessary privilege of the   phon ē   which is implied by the entire history of metaphysics. For Husserl will not recognize an originative af fi nity with the   logos   in general in the sonorous substance or in the physical voice, or in the body of the voice in the world; rather the originative af fi nity will be recognized in the phenomenological voice, in the voice in its transcendental   fl esh, in the breath, in intentional animation which transforms the body of the word into  fl esh,   which   turns   the   Körper   into   Leib,   a   geistige Leiblichkeit.   The phenomenological voice would be this spiritual   fl esh which continues to speak and to be present to itself— to hear itself —in the absence of the <16> world. Of course, what we grant to the voice is granted to the language of  words,   to a language constituted from unities—which we could believe irreducible and indecomposable—welding the signi fi ed concept onto the signifying “phonic complex.” Despite the vigilance of the description, a perhaps naive treatment of the concept of “word” has no doubt failed to resolve in phenomenology the tension between its two major motives: the purity of formalism and the radicality of intuitionism. That the privilege of presence as consciousness can be   established —that is, can be constituted historically as well as demonstrated—only by means of the excellence of the voice is a claim whose obviousness has never held center stage in phenomenology. According to a mode that is neither simply operative nor directly thematic, in a place that is neither central nor lateral, the necessity of this claim’s obviousness seems to have secured a sort of “grip” on all phenomenology. 22   The nature of this “grip” is badly conceived in   the   concepts   usually   devoted   to   the   philosophy   of   the   history   of philosophy. But our purpose here is not to meditate directly on the form of this “grip.” Our purpose is merely to show it as already at work—and powerfully—from the very beginning of the First Logical Investigation.  [a] Edmund Husserl,   Formal and Transcendental Logic,   §35b, pp. 103–4. [b] With the exception of some openings and indispensable anticipations, the present essay analyzes the doctrine of meaning such that it is constituted in the First Logical Investigation. In order to follow better its dif fi cult and tortuous itinerary, we have generally abstained from comparisons, similarities, or oppositions which here and there seem to confront us between the Husserlian theory of meaning and other classical or modern theories of meaning. Each time that we go beyond the text of the First Logical Investigation, we are doing this in order to indicate the principle of a general interpretation of Husserl’s thought and in order to sketch a systematic reading that we hope to attempt one day.\n\n[c] Jacques Derrida, “La phénoménologie et la clôture de la métaphysique,” in   ΕΠΟΧΕΣ,  Athens, February 1966.

[f] Husserl,   Phänomenologishe Psychologie,   p. 343.\n\n1  Sign and Signs  <17> Husserl begins by pointing out a confusion. Within the word “sign” ( Zeichen ), always in   ordinary language and at   times in   philosophical language,   are   hidden   two   heterogeneous   concepts:   that   of   expression  ( Ausdruck ), which we often mistakenly hold as being the synonym of the sign in general, and that of   indication   ( Anzeichen ). Now, according to Husserl, there are some signs that express nothing because these signs carry —we must still say this in German—nothing that we can call   Bedeutung   or  Sinn.   This   is   what   indication   is.   Certainly,   indication   is   a   sign,   like expression. But it is different from expression because it is, insofar as it is an   indication,   deprived   of   Bedeutung   or   Sinn:   bedeutunglos,   sinnlos.  Nevertheless it is not a sign without signi fi cation. Essentially, there cannot be a sign without signi fi cation, a signi fi er without a signi fi ed. This is why the traditional translation of   Bedeutung   by “signi fi cation,” although it is established   and   nearly   inevitable,   risks   blurring   Husserl’s   entire   text, rendering it unintelligible in its axial intention, and consequently rendering unintelligible all of what will depend on these   fi rst “essential distinctions.” One can say with Husserl in German, without absurdity, that a sign ( Zeichen ) is deprived of   Bedeutung   (is   bedeutungslos,   is not   bedeutsam ), but one cannot say in French, without contradiction, that   un signe   is deprived   of   signi fi cation. 1   In   German   one   can   speak   of   expression ( Ausdruck ) as a   bedeutsame Zeichen,   which Husserl does. One cannot, without redundancy, <18> translate   bedeutsame Zeichen   into French as  signe signi fi ant,   which lets us imagine, against the evidence and against Husserl’s intention, that we could have   des signes non signi fi ants.   While being   suspicious   of   the   established   French   translations,   we   must nevertheless confess that it will always be dif fi cult to replace them. This is why our remarks are nothing less than criticisms aimed at the existing, valuable translations. We shall try nevertheless to propose some solutions which will keep to being halfway between commentary and translation. They will thus be valid only within the limits of Husserl’s texts. Most often,\n\nwhen we are confronting a dif fi culty, we shall, according to a procedure whose   value   is   at   times   contestable,   retain   the   German   word   while attempting to clarify it by means of the analysis. In this way, it will be very quickly con fi rmed that, for Husserl, the expressivity of the expression—which always assumes the ideality of a  Bedeutung —has an irreducible link to the possibility of spoken discourse ( Rede ). Expression is a purely linguistic sign and, in the   fi rst analysis, this is precisely what distinguishes it from indication. Although spoken discourse is a very complex structure, involving always,   in fact,   an indicative layer which, as we shall see, we shall have the greatest trouble trying to hold within its limits, Husserl reserves for it the exclusivity of the right to expression and therefore the exclusivity of pure logicity. 2   Without violating Husserl’s   intention,   one   could   de fi ne,   if   not   translate,   “bedeuten”   by “vouloir-dire” at once in the sense of a speaking subject that   wants to say,  “expressing himself,” as Husserl says, “about something”—and in the sense of an expression that   means. [ g] 3   We can then be assured that the   Bedeutung  is always   what   someone or a discourse   means   < veulent dire >: always a sense of discourse, a discursive content. In contrast to Frege, Husserl, as we know, does not distinguish, in the  Logical Investigations,   between   Sinn   and   Bedeutung:  Besides, for us, <19>   Bedeutung   means the same thing as   Sinn   [ gilt als gleichbedeutend mit Sinn ]. On the one hand, it is very convenient, especially in the case of this concept, to have at one’s disposal parallel, interchangeable terms, particularly since the sense of the term   Bedeutung  is itself to be investigated. A further consideration is our ingrained habit to use the two words as meaning the same thing. In these conditions, it seems a rather dubious step if their   Bedeutungen  are differentiated, and if (as G. Frege has proposed) we use one for   Bedeutung   in our sense, and the other for the objects expressed. 4  In   Ideas I,   the dissociation that intervenes between the two terms does not at all have the same function as in Frege, and it con fi rms our reading:  Bedeutung   is reserved for the ideal sense content of   verbal   expression, of spoken discourse, while sense ( Sinn ) covers the whole noematic sphere, including its non-expressive stratum:  We begin with the familiar distinction between the sensuous, so to speak, corporeal side of expression, and its non-sensuous or “spiritual” side. We need not enter into a closer examination of the   fi rst side; likewise, we need not consider the manner of unifying both sides. Obviously, they too designate headings for not unimportant phenomenological problems. We shall restrict\n\nour regard exclusively to “signifying” [ bedeuten ] and “Bedeutung.” Originally, these words concerned only the linguistic sphere [ sprachliche Sphäre ], that of “expressing” [ des Ausdrückens ]. But one can scarcely avoid and, at the same time, take an important cognitive step, extending the   Bedeutung   of these words and suitably modifying them so that they can   fi nd application of a certain kind to the whole noetico-noematic sphere: thus application to all acts, be they now interwoven [ ver fl ochten ] with expressive acts or not. Thus we have continued to speak of “sense” [ Sinn ] in the case of all intentional lived-experience—a word which is used in general as an equivalent <20> to   Bedeutung.   For the sake of distinctness we shall prefer the term  Bedeutung   for the old concept, and, in particular, in the complex locution of “logical  Bedeutung ” or “expressive   Bedeutung. ” We shall continue to use the word “sense” as before in the most all-inclusive range. 5  After having asserted, in a passage to which we shall have to return, that there exists a pre-expressive stratum of lived-experience or sense, and then that this stratum of sense could always receive expression and   Bedeutung,  Husserl proposes that “logical   Bedeutung   is an expression.” 6  The difference between indication and expression appears very quickly, over the course of the description, as a difference that is more   functional  than   substantial.   Indication and expression are functions or signifying relations and not terms. One and the same phenomenon can be apprehended as expression or as indication, as a discursive sign or as a non-discursive sign. That depends on the intentional lived-experience that animates it. The functional character of the description immediately shows the extent of the dif fi culty and gets us right to its center. Two functions can be interwoven or entangled in the same concatenation of signs, in the same signi fi cation. Husserl speaks   fi rst of the addition or of the juxtaposition of one function with the other: “. . . signs in the sense of   indication   [ Anzeichen ] (notes, marks, etc.)   do not express,   unless they ful fi ll,   in addition to   [Husserl’s emphasis,   neben,   “besides”]   the   indicative   function,   a   function   of  Bedeutung. ” 7   But a few lines later, he will speak of intimate intrication, of entanglement ( Ver fl echtung ). This word will reappear often, at decisive moments, and this will not be by chance. It appears already in the   fi rst section: “Meaning [ bedeuten   < vouloir-dire >]—in communicative discourse [ in mitteilender Rede ]—is always interwoven [ ver fl ochten ] in a relation with this indication-being.” 8  We   therefore   already   know   that,   in   fact,   the   discursive   sign   and consequently the meaning < le vouloir-dire > is   always   entangled,   gripped  within an indicative system. <21> The expressive and logical purity of the\n\nBedeutung   that Husserl wants to grasp as the possibility of the   Logos   is gripped, that is, contaminated— in fact and always   ( allzeit ver fl ochten ist ) insofar as the   Bedeutung   is gripped within a communicative discourse. Of course, as we shall see, communication itself is for Husserl a stratum that is extrinsic to expression. But each time that an expression is produced in fact, it carries a communicative value, even if the expression does not exhaust itself in communication or if this value is simply associated with it. It will be necessary to specify the modalities of this interweaving. But it is clear from now on that this factual necessity of entanglement which intimately associates expression and indication must not, in Husserl’s eyes, undermine the possibility of a rigorous essential distinction. This possibility is purely juridical and phenomenological. The whole analysis will move forward therefore in this hiatus between fact and right, existence and essence, reality and the intentional function. By indeed leaping over the mediations and by reversing the apparent order, we would be tempted to say that this hiatus, which de fi nes the very space of phenomenology, does not preexist the question of language, and it is not inserted into phenomenology as within one domain or as one problem among others. It is opened up, on the contrary, only in and by the possibility of language. And its juridical value, the right to a distinction between fact and intentional right, depends entirely on language and, in language, on the validity of a radical distinction between indication and expression. Let us pursue our reading. Every expression would therefore be gripped, despite   itself,   by   an   indicative   process.   But   the   opposite,   Husserl recognizes, is not true. We might therefore be tempted to turn the expressive sign into a species of the genus “indication.” In this case, we would have to say in the end that speech, whatever the dignity or whatever the originality we still grant it, is only a form of gesture. In its essential center and not only by means of what Husserl considers as its accidents (its physical side, its communicative function), <22> speech belongs, without exceeding it, to the general system of signi fi cation. This system would be merged with the system of indication. This is precisely what Husserl contests. In order to do that, he must therefore demonstrate that expression is not a species of indication even though all expressions are mixed with indication, the reverse not being true. Husserl writes,\n\nIf one limits oneself to expressions employed in living colloquy, as one usually does involuntarily when expression is in question, the concept of an indication seems to apply more widely than that of an expression, but this does not mean that its content is the genus of which an expression is the species.   To mean [bedeuten <vouloir-dire>] is not a particular species of sign-being [Zeichenseins] in the sense of indication [Anzeige].   It has a narrower application only because meaning [ bedeuten ]—in communicative discourse—is always entangled [ ver fl ochten ] with indication-being [ Anzeichensein ], and this in its turn leads to a wider concept, since meaning is also capable of occurring outside of this entanglement.[h] 9  In order to demonstrate the rupture of the species-genus relation, we then have to rediscover, if there is any, a phenomenological situation in which expression   is   no   longer   tied   up   in   this   entanglement,   is   no   longer interwoven with indication. Since this contamination is always produced in real colloquy (at once because in real colloquy expression indicates a content that is forever hidden from intuition, namely, the lived-experience of the other, and because the ideal content of the   Bedeutung   and the spiritual side of the expression are united in real colloquy with the sensible side),   it   is   in   a   language   without   communication,   in   a   monological discourse, in the absolutely lowest register of the voice of the “ solitary life of the soul ” ( in einem Seelenleben ) that it is necessary to track down the unmarred purity of expression. Through a strange paradox, the meaning < le vouloir-dire > would isolate the concentrated purity of ex-pressivity only when the relation to a certain   outside   would be suspended. Only to a certain outside, because this <23> reduction will not erase and indeed shall reveal in pure expressivity the relation to the object, the aim of an objective ideality, over and against the intention of meaning < vouloir-dire >, over and against the   Bedeutungsintention.   What we just called a paradox is in truth only the phenomenological project in its essence. Beyond the opposition between “idealism” and “realism,” “subjectivism” and “objectivism,” etc., phenomenological transcendental idealism responds to the necessity to describe the   ob jectivity of the   ob ject ( Gegenstand ) and the   pre sence of the present ( Gegenwart )—and the objectivity in presence—on the basis of an “interiority” or rather on the basis of a self-proximity, of an   ownness  ( Eigenheit ) which is not a simple   inside,   but the intimate possibility of the relation to an over-there and to an outside in general. This is why the essence of intentional consciousness will be revealed (for example in   Ideas I,   §49) only in the reduction of the totality of the existing world in general. This movement is already sketched in the First Logical Investigation in\n\nrelation to expression and meaning < vouloir-dire > as being a relation to the object.   Husserl   says,   “ Expressions   unfold   their   function   of   meaning [ Bedeutungsfunktion   < function de vouloir-dire >] even in   the solitary life of the soul, where they no longer function as indications.   In truth therefore the two concepts of sign are not really related to one another as concepts that are wider or narrower.” 10  Before opening this   fi eld of the solitary life of the soul in order to recover expressivity in it, it is necessary therefore to determine and reduce the domain of indication. This is what Husserl begins by doing. But before following him in this analysis, let us pause for a moment. The movement that we just commented upon is actually open to two possible readings.  On the one hand,   Husserl seems to repress, with a dogmatic haste, a question about the   structure of the sign in general.   By proposing from the start a radical dissociation between two   heterogeneous   types   of sign, between indication and expression, he does not ask himself what the sign   in general   is. The concept of sign in general—which he has to use <24> at the beginning and to which he would have to grant a hearthstead of sense—is able to receive its unity only from an essence. The general concept can only be patterned on the essence. And the essence must be recognized in an essential structure of experience and in the familiarity of a horizon. In order to hear the word “sign” at the opening of the problematic, we must already have a relation of pre-understanding with the essence, the function, or the essential structure of the sign in general. Then, however, will we be able eventually to distinguish between the sign as indication and the sign as expression, even if the two types of signs are not ordered according to the relations of genus and species. According to a distinction which is itself Husserlian (cf. First Logical Investigation, §13), one can say that the category of the sign in general is not a genus but rather a form.  What therefore is a sign in general?   For many reasons, our ambition is not to answer this question. We only want to suggest the sense in which Husserl may seem to evade it. “Every sign is a sign for something”—“for something” ( für etwas ), these are Husserl’s   fi rst words, the words that  immediately   introduce the dissociation of expression from indication: “But not every sign has a ‘Bedeutung,’ a ‘sense’ [ Sinn ] that the sign ‘expresses.’” This presupposes that we knew implicitly what “being-for” means, in the\n\nsense of “being-in-the-place-of.” We must understand in a familiar way this structure   of   substitution   or   of   referral   so   that,   in   this   structure,   the heterogeneity between indicative referral and expressive referral becomes consequently   intelligible,   indeed,   demonstrated—and   even   so   that   the evidentness of their relations comes to be accessible for us, perhaps in the sense in which Husserl hears it. A little later (in §8), Husserl will in fact demonstrate   that   expressive   referral   ( Hinzulenken,   Hinzeigen )   is   not indicative referral ( Anzeigen ). But no original question is posed about  Zeigen in general,   which, pointing the   fi nger in this way at the invisible, can then be modi fi ed into   Hinzeigen   or into   Anzeigen.   However, we can already guess—and perhaps we shall later verify it—that this “Zeigen” is the   place   in   which   the   root   and   the   <25>   necessity   of   all   the “entanglements”   between   indication   and   expression   are   announced. “Zeigen” is the place in which all the oppositions and differences that will henceforth crisscross Husserl’s analysis (and that will be wholly formed within the concepts of traditional metaphysics) are not yet sketched out. But Husserl, choosing the logicity of signi fi cation as his theme, believing already that he is able to isolate the   logical a priori   from pure grammar within the general   a priori   of grammar, is resolutely engaged in one of the modi fi cations   of   the   general   structure   of   Zeigen:   Hinzeigen   and not   Anzeigen.  Does this absence of a question in regard to the starting point and the pre-understanding   of an operative concept necessarily translate   into a dogmatism?   On the other hand,   may we not interpret this as critical vigilance? Is not what is at issue precisely the rejection or erasure of pre- understanding as the apparent starting point, indeed, its rejection or erasure as a kind of prejudice or presumption? By what right may we presume the essential unity of something like the sign? And what if Husserl wanted to break up the unity of the sign, to demonstrate that it has a unity only in appearance, to reduce it to a verbality without concept? And what if there were not   one   concept of sign and   several   types of sign, but two irreducible concepts to which we have improperly attached one sole word? At the beginning of the second section, Husserl speaks precisely of “two concepts attached to the word ‘sign.’” By blaming him for not beginning with an interrogation of the sign-being of the sign in general, are we not trusting in a rather hasty way the unity of a word?\n\nMore seriously, by asking “ what is   the sign in general,” we subordinate the question of the sign to an ontological design. We claim to assign to signi fi cation a place, which might be fundamental or regional, within an ontology.   This   would   be   a   classical   way   of   proceeding.   We   would subordinate the sign to truth, language to being, speech to thought, and writing to speech. 11   Is it not the case that, by saying that there can be a truth for the sign in general, we are assuming that the sign is not the possibility of truth, that the sign does not constitute truth, but is content to signify the truth, <26> to reproduce it, to incarnate it, and to inscribe it secondarily or to refer to it? For, if the sign somehow preceded what we call truth or essence, it would make no sense to speak of the truth or the essence of the sign. Is it not possible to think—and doubtlessly Husserl has done this— that the sign, for example if we consider the sign as the structure of an intentional movement, does not fall under the category of the thing in general ( Sache ), that the sign is not a “being” about whose being we would have just posed a question? Is not the sign something other than a being? Is it not the sole “thing” which, not being a thing, does not fall under the question of “what is”? And in contrast, does not the sign sometimes produce the question, thus produce “philosophy” as the empire of the   ti esti ? By asserting that “logical   Bedeutung   is an expression,” that there is theoretical truth only in a statement, [i]   by engaging resolutely in a question concerning   linguistic   expression   as   the   possibility   of   truth,   by   not presupposing the essential unity of the sign, Husserl could appear to reverse the direction of the traditional procedure and respect in the activity of signi fi cation what, having no truth in itself, conditions the movement and the concept of truth. And in fact, throughout an itinerary that ends up at “The Origin of Geometry,” Husserl will give a growing attention to what in signi fi cation, in language, and in inscription as it writes ideal objectivity down,   produces   truth or ideality rather than   records   it. But this last movement is not simple. Here is our problem and we will have to return to it. The historical destiny of phenomenology seems, no matter what, to be contained between these two motives. On the one hand, phenomenology is the reduction of naive ontology, the return to an active constitution of sense and validity, to the activity <27> of a   life   that produces truth and validity in general through its signs. But at the same time, without\n\nbeing simply juxtaposed to this movement, [ j]   another necessity con fi rms also   the   classical   metaphysics   of   presence   and   indicates   that phenomenology belongs to classical ontology. We have chosen to be interested in this relation in which phenomenology belongs to classical ontology.  [ g] “To mean,” “meaning” <in English> are good equivalents for “bedeuten,” “Bedeutung,” which we do not have in French. [h] First Logical Investigation, §1. [i] This is a very frequent comment, starting with the   Logical Investigations   (cf., for example, introduction, §2) all the way up to “The Origin of Geometry.” [ j] This is a movement on the basis of which we can interpret in diverse ways the relation to metaphysics and to classical ontology. It is a critique which would have determinate, limited, but certain af fi nities with that of Nietzsche and of Bergson. In any case, the critique belongs to the unity of a historical con fi guration. That this critique, in the historical con fi guration of these reversals, continues metaphysics   is   one   of the most permanent   themes of Heidegger’s meditation. So, concerning these problems (the starting point in the pre-understanding of the sense of a word, the privilege of the question “what is,” the relation between language and being or truth, the belonging to classical ontology, etc.), only on the basis of a super fi cial reading of Heidegger’s texts could one conclude that Heidegger’s texts fall under the blow of these objections. On the contrary, we think, without being able to develop it here, that no one has ever better escaped from them prior to Heidegger’s texts, which does not mean that one escapes from the objections often after Heidegger’s texts.\n\n2  The Reduction of Indication  <28> That phenomenology belongs to metaphysics is revealed doubtlessly in the theme to which we are now returning: the exteriority of indication in relation to expression. Husserl devotes only three sections to “ the essence of indication ”   and,   in   the   same   chapter,   eleven   sections   are   devoted   to  expression.   Since, according to a logical and epistemological concern, what is at issue is to secure the originality of expression as “meaning” < vouloir- dire > and as the relation to an ideal object, the treatment of indication must be brief, preliminary, and “reductive.” It is necessary to push indication to the side, abstract it, “reduce” it as an extrinsic and empirical phenomenon, even though a strict relation unites it in fact to expression, interweaves it empirically with expression. But such a reduction is dif fi cult. Only in appearance does it look as though at the end of the third section the reduction is accomplished. Indicative attachments, at times of another type, will not stop appearing later, and their elimination will be an in fi nite task. Husserl’s whole enterprise—and well beyond the   Logical Investigations — will be threatened if the   Ver fl echtung   attaching indication onto expression is absolutely irreducible and in principle inextricable, if indication were not added onto expression as a more or less tenacious bond, but inhabited the essential intimacy of the movement of expression. What is an indicative sign? First it can be   natural   (the canals of Mars  indicate   the possible presence of intelligent beings) <29> as well as  arti fi cial   (the chalk mark, branding, all the instruments of conventional designation). [k]   The   opposition   between   nature   and   institution   has   no relevance here and does not divide the unity of the indicative function. What is this unity? Husserl describes it as that of a certain “motivation” ( Motivierung ). Motivation is what gives to something like a “thinking being” the movement in order   to pass   in thought from something to something. For the moment, this de fi nition must remain rather general. This passage   can   be   that   of   conviction   ( Überzeugung )   or   of   presumption ( Vermutung ) and it always links an   actual   knowledge right now to a   non-\n\nactual   knowledge. 1   In relation to motivation considered at this degree of generality, this knowledge can concern any object ( Gegenstand ) or state-of- affair   ( Sachverhalt )   and   not   necessarily   empirical   existents,   that   is, individuals. In order to designate the category of the known (actual or non- actual), Husserl by design makes use therefore of very general concepts ( Sein, Bestand ) which can cover being or subsistence, the structure of ideal objects as well as empirical existents.   Sein, bestehen, Bestand —words that are frequent and fundamental at the beginning of this section—are not to be reduced to   Dasein, existieren, Realität,   and this difference is quite important to Husserl, as we are going to verify in a moment. Husserl thus de fi nes the most general essential common characteristic <30> that gathers together all the indicative functions:  In these cases we discover as a common characteristic the following situation: certain objects or  states of affairs   whatsoever whose   subsistence   [ Bestand ] of which someone has   actual  knowledge indicate [ anzeigen ] to him the   subsistence of certain other objects or states of affairs,   in the sense that   his conviction in the being [Sein] of the one is experienced as motivating (though as a non-evident motivation) a conviction or a presumption in the being   of the others.[l] 2  But this essential common characteristic is still so general that it covers the whole   fi eld of indication and something else as well. Or rather, since it is really an   Anzeigen   that is being described here, let us say that this essential common characteristic over fl ows indication   in the strict sense.   We are now going to have to approach this strict sense of indication. And we see then why it was important to distinguish between   Sein   and   Bestand   on the one hand, and   Existenz, Dasein,   or   Realität   on the other. General motivation thus de fi ned is that of a “because” which can have the sense of indicative allusion ( Hinweis ) as well as that of deductive, evident, and apodictic demonstration ( Beweis ). In the latter case, the “because” links together evident and ideal necessities which are permanent and persistent beyond every empirical   hic et nunc.   Husserl says, “An ideal rule is here revealed   which   extends   its   sway   beyond   the   judgments   linked   by motivation   hic et nunc   and embraces as such in a meta-empirical generality all the judgments of like content and moreover all the judgments of like ‘form’ [ Form ].” 3   Motivations linking lived-experiences, the   acts   intending objective-ideal, necessary, and evident idealities may be of the order of contingent   and   empirical,   “non-evident”   indication.   But   the   relations\n\nuniting the   contents   of ideal objects, in evidential demonstration, do not belong to indication. The entire analysis of section 3 demonstrates that (1) even if A indicates B with a complete   empirical   certainty (with the highest probability), this indication will never be a demonstration of apodictic necessity, and, to   fi nd here again the classic schema, it will never be a demonstration <31> of “truths of reason” in opposition to “truths of fact.” Section 3’s analysis also demonstrates (2) that even if indication seems nevertheless to intervene in a demonstration, it will always be on the side of psychical motivations, acts, convictions, etc., and never on the side of the contents of truths that are linked together. This indispensable distinction between   Hinweis   and   Beweis,   indication and demonstration, not only poses a problem formally analogous to the one that we were opening up earlier in relation to   Zeigen.   What is monstration ( Weisen ) in general prior to its distribution into indication that points the  fi nger ( Hinweis ) at the non-seen and into demonstration ( Beweis ) which allows something to be seen in the evidentness of the proof? 4   Also, this distinction sharpens then the dif fi culty of the “entanglement” that we have already pointed out. In fact, we know now that, in the order of signi fi cation in general, every psychical lived-experience, on the side of its   acts,   even when the acts aim at idealities   and   objective   necessities,   is   involved   only   with   indicative concatenations. Indication falls outside of the content of absolutely ideal objectivity, that is, outside of the truth. Here again, this exteriority, or rather this extrinsic characteristic of indication, is inseparable, in its possibility, from the possibility of all the reductions to come, whether they are eidetic or transcendental. Having its “origin” in phenomena of association [m]   <32> and   always   connecting   empirical   existents   in   the   world,   indicative signi fi cation will cover, in language, all of what falls under the blows of the “reductions”: factuality, mundane existence, essential non-necessity, non- evidence, etc. Do we not already have the right to say that the entire future problematic of the reduction and all the conceptual differences in which they are declared (fact/essence, transcendentality/mundanity, and all the oppositions that are systematic with them) are developed in a   hiatus  between two types of signs? At the same time as the hiatus, if not in it and thanks to it? Is it not the case that the concept of   parallelism,   which de fi nes the relations between the pure psychical—which is in the world—and the\n\npure   transcendental—which   is   not   in   the   world—and   which   gathers together in this way the entire enigma of Husserl’s phenomenology, is it not the case that this is announced here in the form of a relation between two modes of signi fi cation? And yet Husserl, who never wanted to assimilate experience in general (empirical or transcendental experience) to language, is constantly going to try to keep signi fi cation outside the self-presence of transcendental life. The question that we just raised would make us pass from commentary to interpretation. If we could answer the question in the af fi rmative, we would have to conclude, against Husserl’s express intention, that the “reduction,” even before it becomes a method, would be merged with the most spontaneous act of spoken discourse, the simple practice of speech, the power of expression. Although this conclusion must constitute in our eyes, in a certain sense, the “truth” of phenomenology, it would contradict at a certain level Husserl’s express intention for two sorts of reasons. <33> On the one hand, this conclusion goes against Husserl’s express intention because, as we were recalling earlier, Husserl believes in the existence of a pre-expressive and pre-linguistic stratum of sense which the reduction will at times have to unveil by excluding the stratum of language. On the other hand, if there is no expression and no meaning < vouloir-dire >   without   discourse,   not   all   discourse   is   “expressive.” Although there is no possible discourse without an expressive kernel, we could almost say that the totality of discourse is gripped by an indicative web.  [k] In the logic of his examples and of his analysis, Husserl could have cited the   grapheme   in general. Although writing is for him—there is no doubt about it— indicative   in its proper stratum, it poses a considerable problem which probably explains Husserl’s careful silence here. Even if we suppose that writing is indicative in the sense that he gives to this word, it has a strange privilege that risks the disorganization of all the essential distinctions. What phonetic writing (or better, in the purely phonetic part of the kind of writing that is improperly and globally called phonetic) would “indicate” would be an “expression.” Non-phonetic writing would be substituted for expressive discourse in such a way that non-phonetic discourse would substitute for that which unites expressive discourse immediately to the “meaning” < vouloir-dire > ( bedeuten ). We are not here stressing this problem, but it belongs to the ultimate horizon of this essay. [l] First Logical Investigation, §2. [m] Cf. §4: “The psychical facts in which the notion of indication has its ‘origin,’ i.e., in which it can be abstractively apprehended, belong to the wider group of facts which fall under the historical rubric of the ‘association of ideas.’” <Translator: First Logical Investigation, §4; the equivalent passage can be found on page 186 of the English translation, volume 1.> We know that, while\n\nrenewing it and using it in the   fi eld of transcendental experience, Husserl has never stopped working with the concept of “association.” Here, what is excluded from pure expressivity is indication and thereby association in the sense of empirical psychology. We must bracket empirical psychical lived- experiences in order to recognize the ideality of the   Bedeutung   that orders expression. The distinction between indication and expression appears therefore   fi rst of all in the necessarily and provisionally “objectivist” phase of phenomenology, when one has to neutralize empirical subjectivity. Does it keep its value when the transcendental thematic will found the analysis and when we return to constituting subjectivity? Such is the question which Husserl has never opened afterward. He has continued to make use of the “essential distinctions” from the   fi rst of the   Logical Investigations.   He has never, however, started over, repeated, in regard to them this work of thematization by which all his other concepts have been untiringly taken up, veri fi ed, constantly reappearing at the center of a description\n\n3  Meaning as Soliloquy  <34>   Let   us   suppose   that   indication   is   excluded.   What   remains   is expression. What is expression? It is a sign charged with   Bedeutung.  Husserl attempts to de fi ne it in the   fi fth section:   Ausdrücke als bedeutsame Zeichen.   Expressions are signs that “mean” < veulent-dire >. 1  A) Doubtlessly   Bedeutung   comes upon the sign and transforms it into expression only with speech, with oral discourse. Husserl writes, “from  indicative   signs we distinguish   meaningful   signs, i.e.,   expressions. ” But why expressions and why “meaningful” signs < signes “voulant-dire” >? We are able to explain this only by tying together a whole sheaf of reasons within the profound unity of one and the same intention. 1. Ex-pression is exteriorization. Expression imprints in a certain outside a sense which is discovered   fi rst in a certain inside. Earlier we suggested that this outside and this inside were absolutely original: the outside is neither   nature,   nor   the   world,   nor   a   real   exteriority   in   relation   to consciousness. Here is the place to specify this outside. The   bedeuten  intends an outside which is that of an ideal ob-ject. This outside then is ex- pressed, passes outside of itself into another outside, which is still “in” consciousness. As we are going to see, expressive discourse has no need, as such and in its essence, of being factually uttered in the world. Expression as a meaningful sign < signe voulant-dire > <35> is therefore a double exiting of sense ( Sinn ) outside of itself in itself, in consciousness, in the with-itself and the nearby-itself that Husserl begins by determining as the “solitary life of the soul.” 2   Later, after the discovery of the transcendental reduction, he will describe the solitary life of the soul as the noetico- noematic sphere of consciousness. If we refer, in anticipation and for the sake of more clarity, to the corresponding sections of   Ideas I,   we see how the “unproductive” stratum of expression comes to re fl ect, “to mirror” ( widerzuspiegeln ) every other intentionality in regard to its form and to its content. The relation to objectivity therefore indicates a “pre-expressive” ( vor-ausdrücklich ) intentionality that aims at a sense which will be then\n\ntransformed into a   Bedeutung   and an expression. It is not at all obvious that this re fl ected and repeated “exiting” toward the noematic sense and then toward expression is an unproductive redoubling, especially if we consider that   by   “unproductivity”   Husserl   intends   thus   a   “ productivity   that   is exhausted in the expressing and in the form of the conceptual   which is introduced with the expression.” [n] 3   Therefore we will have to return to this. We only wanted to note here what “expression” means according to Husserl: the exiting of an act outside of itself, then of a sense which is able to remain in itself only in the voice, in the “phenomenological” voice. 2.   In   the   Logical Investigations,   the   word   “expression”   is   already imposed   for   another   reason.   Expression   is   an   intentional,   thoroughly conscious,   decided,   voluntary   exteriorization.   There   is   no   expression without the intention of a subject animating the sign, endowing it with  Geistigkeit.   In indication, animation has two limits: the body of the sign which is not a breath, and the indicated, which is an existence in the world. In expression, the intention is absolutely on purpose <36> because it animates   a   voice   which   can   remain   wholly   internal   and   because   the expressed is a   Bedeutung,   that is, an ideality that does not “exist” in the world. 3. Looking at it from another viewpoint will con fi rm that there can be no expression without a voluntary intention. In fact, expression is always inhabited, animated by a   bedeuten,   as a   wanting -to-say < vouloir-dire >, because   for   Husserl   the   Deutung,   let   us   say,   the   interpretation,   the understanding, or the cognition, of the   Bedeutung   can never have taken place outside of oral discourse ( Rede ). Only such a discourse can make itself available to a   Deutung.   The latter is never essentially a reading but rather a hearing. What “wants to say,”   what   the “meaning” wants to say, the  Bedeutung,   is reserved for the one who speaks and who speaks insofar as he says what he   wants   to say: on purpose, explicitly, and consciously. Let us verify this. Husserl recognizes that his use of the word “expression” “constrains” the language a little. But the constraint which is thus practiced puri fi es his intention and at once reveals a common stock of metaphysical implications. Husserl writes, “We shall lay down, for provisional intelligibility, that each discourse [ Rede ] or part of discourse [ Redeteil ], as also each sign that is essentially of the same sort, shall count as an expression, whether or not\n\nsuch discourse is actually uttered [ wirklich geredet ], or addressed with communicative intent to any persons or not.” 4   Thus all of what constitutes the actuality of what is uttered, the physical incarnation of the   Bedeutung,  the   body   of   speech,   which   in   its   ideality   belongs   to   an   empirically determinate language, is, if not outside of discourse, at least foreign to expressivity as such, to this pure intention without which no discourse would be possible. The entire stratum of empirical actuality, that is, the factual totality of discourse, belongs to this indication, the extent of which we have not   fi nished recognizing. The actuality, the totality of these events of discourse, is not only indicative because it is in the world, abandoned to the world, but also, correlatively, because, as <37> such, the actuality of discourse keeps in   itself something of   involuntary   association.   For   if intentionality has never simply meant will < volonté >, it indeed seems that in the order of the lived-experiences of expression (supposing that it has limits)   intentional   consciousness   and   voluntary   consciousness   are,   in Husserl’s eyes, synonyms. And if we were just thinking—as Husserl will authorize   in   Ideas   I —that   every   intentional   lived-experience   can   in principle be taken up into a lived-experience of expression, we should perhaps conclude that, despite all the themes of receptive or intuitive intentionality and of passive genesis, the concept of intentionality is still taken in the tradition of a voluntaristic metaphysics, that is, perhaps taken simply   in   the   metaphysics.   The   explicit   teleology   that   orders   all   of transcendental phenomenology would basically be only a transcendental voluntarism. Sense wants to signify itself; it expresses itself only in a wanting-to-say which is only a wanting-to-say-itself of the presence of sense. This explains that all of what escapes from pure spiritual intention, from pure animation by the   Geist   which is the will, all of that is excluded from  bedeuten   and therefore from expression: for example, facial expressions, the various gestures, the totality of the body and of mundane registration, in a word, the totality of the visible as such and of the spatial as such. As such —that is, insofar as they are not worked over by   Geist,   by the will, by the  Geistigkeit   which, in the word as well as in the human body, transforms the  Körper   into   Leib   (into   fl esh). The opposition of the soul and the body is not only at the center of this doctrine of signi fi cation, it is con fi rmed by the doctrine and, as it has always basically been done in philosophy, the\n\nopposition depends on an interpretation of language. Visibility as such and spatiality as such could only lose the self-presence of the will and of the spiritual animation which opens up discourse.   They are literally the death of that self-presence.   Thus, as Husserl writes,  Such a de fi nition excludes [from expression] facial expressions and the various gestures which <38> involuntarily [ unwillkürlich ] accompany speech without communicative intent, or those in which a person’s psychic states achieve understandable “expression” for his environment, without the added help of discourse. Such “externalizations” [ Äusserungen ] are not expressions in the sense of discourse [ Rede ], they have no phenomenal unity, in the consciousness of the one who externalizes himself, with the externalized lived-experiences. By means of them, an individual communicates nothing to another. In the externalization of these lived-experiences by means of them, the intention to expose some “thought” in an express way [ in ausdrücklicher Weise ] is missing, whether for the individual himself, in his solitary state, or for others. Such “expressions,” in short, have properly speaking no   Bedeutung. 5  They do not want   to say   anything because they do not   want   to say anything. In the order of signi fi cation, the express intention is an intention to express. The implicit does not belong to the essence of discourse. What Husserl asserts here concerning gestures and facial expressions would of course have to hold   a fortiori   for preconscious or unconscious language. That we may eventually “interpret” the gesture, the facial expression, the non-conscious, the involuntary, indication in general, that we may at times take   them   up   and   make   them   explicit   in   a   discursive   and   express commentary,   that   only   con fi rms,   in   Husserl’s   eyes,   the   preceding distinctions. This interpretation ( Deutung ) makes a latent expression be  heard,   a wanting-to-say ( bedeuten   < vouloir-dire >) which was still holding itself in reserve. Non-expressive signs want to say ( bedeuten ) only insofar as one can make them say what was murmuring in them, what was wanting to be said in a sort of mumbling. Gestures want to say only insofar as we can listen to them, interpret them ( deuten ). As long as we identify   Sinn   and  Bedeutung,   all of what resists the   Deutung   has no sense and is not language in the strict sense. The essence of language is its   telos   and its   telos   is voluntary consciousness as wanting-to-say. The indicative sphere which remains outside <39> expressivity so de fi ned demarcates the failure of this  telos.   The indicative sphere represents all of what, while interweaving itself with expression, cannot be taken up into a deliberate discourse that is permeated by wanting-to-say.\n\nFor all of these reasons, we do not have the right to distinguish between indication and expression as between a non-linguistic sign and a linguistic sign. Husserl traces out a border which does not pass between language and non-language, but, within language in general, between the express and the non-express (with all of their connotations). For it would be dif fi cult—and  in fact   impossible—to exclude from language all the indicative forms. At most, we can therefore distinguish with Husserl between linguistic signs “in the strict sense” and linguistic signs in the broad sense. Justifying his exclusion of gestures and facial expression, Husserl in effect concludes:  It is not to the point that another person may interpret [ deuten ] our involuntary externalizations [ unwillkürlichen Äusserungen ], e.g., our “expressive movements,” and that he may thereby become deeply acquainted with our inner thoughts and emotions. They (these externalizations) “want to say” [ bedeuten ] something to him insofar as he interprets [ deutet ] them, but even for him they have no   Bedeutungen   in the strict sense of linguistic signs [ im prägnanten Sinne sprachlicher Zeichen ], but only in the sense of indicating.[o] 6  This leads us to look for the limit of the indicative   fi eld still farther. In fact, even for the one who restores the discursivity in the gestures of others, the indicative manifestations of others are not transformed into expressions. It is the interpreter who expresses himself in regard to them. Perhaps there is something in the relation to others that makes indication irreducible. B) In fact, it is not enough to recognize oral discourse as the milieu of expressivity. Once we have excluded all the non-discursive signs which are given immediately as exterior to speech (gestures, facial expressions), still <40> we   fi nd, this time within speech, a non-expressivity whose scope is considerable. This non-expressivity is not only based on the physical side of expression (“the sensible sign, the articulate phonic complex, the sign written   on   paper”).   Husserl   writes,   “The   simple   distinction   between physical signs and sense-giving lived-experiences in general is by no means enough, and not at all enough for logical purposes.” 7  Considering now the non-physical side of discourse, Husserl therefore excludes from it, always under the heading of indication, all that arises from the   communication   or   from   the   manifestations   of   psychical   lived- experience. The movement that justi fi es this exclusion should teach us a lot about the metaphysical tenor of this phenomenology. The themes which are presented here will never be put back into question by Husserl. On the contrary, they will constantly get con fi rmed. They are going to make us\n\nthink that what, in the   fi nal analysis, separates expression from indication is what we could call the immediate non-self-presence of the living present. The   values   of   mundane   existence,   naturality,   sensibility,   empiricity, association, etc., which determined the concept of indication, are perhaps— across of course many mediations that we are anticipating—going to   fi nd their   fi nal unity in this non-presence. And this non-self-presence of the living present will qualify simultaneously the relation to others in general and the self-relation of temporalization. This is sketched out slowly, discretely, but rigorously in the   Logical Investigations.   We have seen that the difference between indication and expression was functional or intentional but not substantial. Husserl can therefore consider that the elements of the order that is substantially discursive (words, the parts of discourse in general) function in certain cases as indications. And this indicative function of discourse is massively at work.   All discourse, insofar as it is engaged in a communication and insofar as it manifests lived-experiences, operates as indication.   In this case, words act like gestures. Or <41> rather, the very concept of gesture should be determined on the basis of indication as non-expressivity. Husserl admits, of course, that the function for which expression is “originally framed” is communication. [ p] 8   And yet expression is never purely itself insofar as it ful fi lls this originative function. Only when communication is suspended is pure expressivity able to appear. What in fact happens in communication? Sensible (audible or visible, etc.) phenomena are animated by the acts of a subject who endows them with   sense,   and   simultaneously   another   subject   must   understand   the animating subject’s intention. Now “animation” cannot be pure and total. It must traverse the non-diaphaneity of a body and in a certain way be lost there. Husserl writes,  But this communication becomes a possibility if the auditor also understands the speaker’s intention. He does this inasmuch as he takes the speaker to be a person, who is not merely uttering sounds but   speaking to him,   who is accompanying those sounds with certain sense- giving acts, which the sounds reveal to the hearer, or whose sense they seek to communicate to him. What   fi rst makes spiritual exchange possible, and turns connected discourse into a discourse, lies in the correlation among corresponding physical and psychic lived-experiences of communicating persons which is mediated by the physical side of speech. 9  Everything in my discourse which is destined to manifest a lived-\n\nexperience to another person must pass through the mediation of the physical side. This irreducible mediation involves every expression in an indicative operation. The manifestation function ( kundgebende Funktion ) is an indicative function. Here we are drawing near to the root of indication: there is indication each time that an act endowing sense, the animating intention, the living spirituality of a meaning < vouloir-dire >, is not fully present. In effect, when I listen to another person, his lived-experience is not present to me “in person” and originally. I can have, <42> Husserl thinks, an originary intuition, that is, an immediate perception, of what is exposed of that person in the world, the visibility of his body, his gestures, a perception of what lets itself be heard from the sounds that he utters. But the subjective side of his experience, his consciousness, the acts by which in particular he endows sense to the signs, are not immediately and originarily present as they are for him and as mine are for me. Here we have an irreducible and de fi nitive limit. The lived-experience of another becomes manifest to me only insofar as it is mediately indicated by the signs involving a physical side. The very idea of the “physical,” of the “physical side,” can only be thought in its proper difference on the basis of this movement of indication. In order to explain the irreducibly indicative character of manifestation, even in discourse, Husserl already proposes motives whose system the   fi fth of   the   Cartesian   Meditations   will   develop   minutely.   Outside   of   the transcendental monadic sphere of my own ( mir eigenes ), outside of the propriety of my own ( Eigenheit ), of my presence to myself, I have with what another owns, with the other’s presence to himself, only relations of  analogical appresentation,   relations of   mediate and potential intentionality.  Originary presentation is forbidden to me. What will be described then under   the   watchful   eye   of   a   differentiated,   audacious,   and   rigorous transcendental reduction is here in the   Logical Investigations   sketched out in the “parallel” dimension of the psychical. Husserl writes,  The hearer perceives the manifestation in the same sense in which he perceives the very person who manifests—even though the psychic phenomena which make him a person cannot fall, for what they are, in the intuitive grasp of another. Common language credits us with percepts even of other people’s psychic lived-experiences; we “see” their anger, their pain, etc. Such talk is quite correct, as long as, e.g., we allow outward bodily things likewise to count as perceived, and as long as, in general, the notion of <43> perception is not restricted to adequate perception,\n\nto intuition in the strict sense. If the essential characteristic of perception lies in the intuitive intention [ Vermeinen ] claiming to grasp a thing or an event insofar as they are themselves present [ gegenwärtigen ]—such an intention is possible, and it is even given in the immense majority of cases without any conceptual or express formulation—then the grasping of the manifestation [ Kundnahme ] is a simple perception of the manifestation [ Kundgabe ]. . . . The hearer perceives the fact that the one who is speaking is externalizing certain psychic lived- experiences, and to that extent he also perceives these lived-experiences. He does not, however, live them himself; he has no “internal” perception of them, only an “external” perception. Here we have the big difference between the actual grasp of a being in adequate intuition, and the intended [ vermeintlichen ] grasp of a being upon the foundation of an intuitive but inadequate representation. In the former case, we have to do with a being given in lived-experience, in the latter case with a presumed [ supponiertes ] being, to which no truth corresponds at all. Mutual understanding demands a certain correlation among the psychic acts which are unfolded from the two sides of manifestation and in the grasping of the manifestation, but not at all their full identity. 10  The   notion   of   presence   is   the   nerve   of   this   demonstration.   If communication or manifestation ( Kundgabe ) is essentially indicative, it is so because the presence of the other’s lived-experience is denied to our originary intuition. Each time that the immediate and full presence of the signi fi ed will be stolen away, the signi fi er will be of an indicative nature. (This   is   why   Kundgabe,   which   we   are   translating   loosely   by “manifestation,” does not manifest, renders nothing manifest, if manifest means evident, open, offered “in person.”   Kundgabe   announces and at the same time snatches away what it is informing us about.) All discourse, or rather, all of what, in discourse, does not restore the immediate presence of the signi fi ed content, is in-expressive. Pure expressivity will be the pure active intention (spirit, psyche, life, will) of a <44>   bedeuten   that is animating a discourse whose content ( Bedeutung ) will be present. It is present not in nature, since indication alone takes place in nature and in space, but in consciousness. Therefore it is present to an “internal” intuition or to an “internal” perception. But we just understood why it is present to an intuition that is not that of the other in a case of communication. Therefore this is   self-present   in the life of a present that has still not exited from itself into the world, into space, into nature. With all of these “exitings” exiling this life of self-presence into indication, we can be sure that indication, which covers so far nearly the entire surface of language, is the process of death at work in the signs. And as soon as the other appears, indicative\n\nlanguage—which is another name of the relation to death—no longer lets itself be erased. The relation to the other as non-presence is therefore the impurity of expression. In order to reduce indication in language and attain once more  fi nally pure expressivity, it is therefore necessary to suspend the relation to others. Then I would no longer have to pass through the mediation of the physical   side   or   through   any   appresentation   in   general.   Section   8, “Expressions in the Solitary Life of the Soul,” follows therefore a path which, from two viewpoints, is parallel to the path of the reduction to the monadic sphere of   Eigenheit   in the   Cartesian Meditations:   the parallel of the psychical and the transcendental, and the parallel of the stratum of expressive   lived-experiences   and   the   stratum   of   lived-experiences   in general. Husserl says,  So far we have considered expressions as used in communication, which last depend essentially on the fact that they operate indicatively. But expressions also play a great part in the life of the soul insofar as it is not engaged in a relation of communication. This change in function plainly has nothing to do with whatever makes an expression an expression. Expressions continue to have their   Bedeutungen   as they had before, and the same   Bedeutungen   as in dialogue. A word only ceases to be a word when our interest is directed exclusively on <45> the sensible, when it becomes a simple phonic form. But when we live in the understanding of a word, it expresses something and the same thing, whether we address it to anyone or not. It seems clear, therefore, that an expression’s   Bedeutung,   and what yet belongs to it essentially, cannot coincide with its activity of manifestation. 11  The   fi rst   advantage of this reduction   to   the   interior   monologue is therefore that the physical event of language seems to be indeed absent from interior monologue. To the extent that the unity of the word—what makes it recognizable as a word, as   the same   word, the unity of a phonic complex and a sense—cannot be merged with the multiplicity of the sensible events of its employment nor does it depend on them, the   sameness  of the word is ideal. It is the ideal possibility of repetition and it loses nothing with the reduction of   any,   and therefore of   every   empirical event marked by its appearance. While “what we are to use as an indication [the distinctive sign] must be perceived by us as an existent,” 12   the unity of a word owes nothing to its   existence   ( Dasein, Existenz ). Its expressivity, which does not need an empirical body but only the ideal and identical form of this body insofar as it is animated by a wanting-to-say, owes nothing to\n\nany mundane, empirical, etc. existence. In “the solitary life of the soul,” the pure unity of expression as such should therefore   fi nally be restored to me. Is this to say that in speaking to myself I communicate nothing to myself? Is it the case that then the “Kundgabe” and the “Kundnahme” are suspended? Is it the case that non-presence is reduced and with it indication, analogical detour, etc.? Do I then no longer modify myself? Is it the case that I learn nothing about myself? Husserl considers the objection and then sets it aside: “Shall one say that one who speaks in solitude to himself, and that for him also the words serve as signs [ Zeichen ], namely, indications [ Anzeichen ] of his own psychic lived-experiences? I do not think that such a view must be held.” 13  <46> Husserl’s argumentation here is decisive and we must follow it closely. The whole theory of signi fi cation announced in this   fi rst chapter of essential distinctions would collapse if a function of   Kundgabe/Kundnahme  would not let itself be reduced in the sphere of my own lived-experiences, and if overall the ideal or absolute solitude of “proper” subjectivity still needed   indications   in   order   to   constitute   its   own   self-relation.   And fundamentally let us not deceive ourselves here: the need for indications means quite simply the need for signs. For it is more and more clear that, despite the initial distinction between the indicative sign and the expressive sign, only indication is truly a sign for Husserl. Full expression—that is, as we shall see later, the ful fi lled intention of the meaning—in a certain way, escapes from the concept of sign. Already in the sentence that we just cited from Husserl, we could read: “signs, namely, indications.” But let us still consider that as a slip of the tongue whose truth will be revealed only later. Instead of saying “signs, namely, indications” ( als Zeichen, nämlich als Anzeichen ), let us say: “signs, namely, signs in the form of indications.” For on the surface of his text, Husserl continues to respect for the moment the initial distinction between two sorts of signs. In order to demonstrate that indication no longer functions in the solitary life of the soul, Husserl begins by marking the difference between two kinds of “referral”: referral as   Hinzeigen   (which we must keep from translating as indication, at least for conventional reasons and if we do not want   to   destroy   the   coherence   of   the   text;   let   us   say   arbitrarily “monstration”) and referral as   Anzeigen   (indication). Now, as Husserl writes, if in silent monologue “words function as signs here as they do\n\neverywhere,”   and   if   “everywhere   we   can   speak   simply   of   an   act   of monstration [ Hinzeigen ],” 14   then the transgression of expression toward sense, of the signi fi er toward the signi fi ed, is here no longer an indication. The   Hinzeigen   is not an   Anzeigen.   For this transgression or, if you like, here this referral <47> does without all existence ( Dasein, Existenz ). In contrast, in indication, an existing sign, an empirical event refers to a content whose existence   is   at   least   presumed.   It   motivates   our   anticipation   or   our conviction of the existence of what is indicated. We cannot think indication without   making   the   category   of   empirical,   that   is,   merely   probable, existence   intervene,   and   this   will   also   be   the   de fi nition   of   mundane existence for Husserl in opposition to the existence of the   ego cogito.   The reduction to monologue is really a bracketing of empirical, mundane existence. In the “solitary life of the soul,” we no longer make use of   real  ( wirklich ) words, but only of   represented   ( vorgestellt ) words. And lived- experience—about which we were wondering if it was not itself “indicated” to   the   speaking   subject—does   not   have   to   be   thus   indicated;   it   is immediately certain and self-present. While in real communication, existing signs   indicate   other   existents which are   only   probable and mediately evoked, in monologue, when the expression is   full, [ q] 15   non-existent signs  show   <48> the signi fi eds ( Bedeutungen ), which are ideal and therefore non- existent, and certain, for they are present to intuition. As for the certainty of internal existence, it has no need, Husserl thinks, of being signi fi ed. It is immediately present to itself. It is living consciousness. In interior monologue, the word would therefore be merely represented. Its place can be the imaginary ( Phantasie ). We are content to imagine the word whose existence is in this way neutralized. In this imagination of the word, in this imaginary representation of the word ( Phantasievorstellung ), we no longer need the empirical event of the word. We are indifferent to its existence or non-existence. For if we need then the   imagination   of the word, at the same time we do without the   imagined word.   The imagination of the word, the imagined, the imagined-being of the word, its “image,” is not the (imagined) word. Just as in the perception of the word, the (perceived or appearing) word which is “in the world” belongs to a radically different order from that of the perception or the appearing of the word, the perceived-being of the word, likewise the (imagined) word is of a radically heterogeneous order from that of the imagination of the word.\n\nThis difference, which is at once simple and subtle, makes the irreducible speci fi city of phenomenality appear. We are able to understand nothing of phenomenology if we do not pay constant and vigilant attention to this speci fi city. But why is Husserl not satis fi ed with the difference between the existing (perceived)   word   and   the   perception   or   the   perceived   being,   the phenomenon of the word? It is because in the phenomenon of perception, a reference is located in phenomenality itself to the existence of the word. The sense “existence” belongs then to the phenomenon. This is no longer the case in the phenomenon of imagination. In imagination, the existence of the word is not implied, not even by means of the intentional sense. What then   exists   is only the imagination of the word, which is itself absolutely certain and self-present insofar as it is a lived-experience. What we already have here is a phenomenological reduction, that isolates the subjective lived-experience as the <49> sphere of absolute certainty and absolute existence. This absolute of existence appears only in the reduction of existence that is relative to the transcendent world. And it is already imagination, “the vital element of phenomenology” ( Ideas I ), 16   which gives this movement its privileged medium. Husserl writes,  Here [in solitary discourse], we are in general content with represented words rather than with real words. In imagination, a spoken or printed word   fl oats before us, though in reality it has no existence. We should not, however, confuse imaginative representations [ Phantasievorstellungen ], and still less the contents of imagination on which they rest, with their imagined objects. The imagined verbal sound, or the imagined printed word, does not exist, only its imaginative representation does so. The difference is the difference between imagined centaurs and the imagination of such beings. The word’s non-existence [ Nicht-Existenz ] neither disturbs nor interests us, since it leaves the word’s expressive function unaffected. 17  This argumentation would be very fragile if it appealed only to a classical psychology of imagination. And it would be really unwise to understand it in this way. For such a psychology, the image is a picture-sign whose   reality   (whether it is physical or psychical) indicates the imagined object. Husserl will show in   Ideas I   how such a conception leads to aporias.  [r]   Insofar as it is the intentional sense <50> or noema, and although it belongs   to   the   sphere   of   the   existence   and   absolute   certainty   of consciousness, the image is not a reality duplicating another reality. This is\n\nthe case not only because the image is not a reality ( Realität ) in nature, but also because the noema is a non-reell ( reell ) component of consciousness. Saussure was also careful to distinguish between the real word and its image. He acknowledged the expressive value of the “signi fi er” solely in the form of the “acoustic image.” [s] 18   <51> “Signi fi er” means “acoustic image.”   But   since   Saussure   does   not   take   the   “phenomenological” precaution, he turns the acoustic image, the signi fi er as a “psychical impression,” into a reality whose sole originality is to be interior; by doing this, he only moves the problem to a different place. Now, if Husserl, in the  Logical Investigations,   leads   his   description   into   a   psychical   and   not transcendental zone, he then nevertheless discerns the essential components of a structure that he will delineate in   Ideas I:   phenomenal lived-experience does not belong to reality ( Realität ). In phenomenal lived-experience, certain elements belong in a reell manner ( reell ) to consciousness ( hyle, morph ē ,   and   noesis ), but the noematic content, the <52> sense is a non-reell ( reell )   component   of   the   lived-experience. [t]   The   irreality   of   internal discourse is therefore a very differentiated structure. Husserl very precisely writes, although without emphasis:  . . . a spoken or printed word   fl oats before us, though in reality, it has no existence. We should not, however, confuse imaginative representations [ Phantasievorstellungen ],   and still less   [my emphasis] the contents of imagination on which they rest, with their imagined objects. 19  Therefore, not only does the imagination of the word, which is not the imagined word, not exist, but the   content   (the noema) of this imagination exists   still less   than the act.  [n]   Ideas I,   §124. Elsewhere we analyze more directly the problematic of “wanting-to-say” and expression in   Ideas I.   See “La forme et le vouloir-dire: Note sur la phénoménologie du langage,” in  Revue internationale de philosophie,   Sept. 1967. [o] First Logical Investigation, §5 [ p] First Logical Investigation, §7. [ q] In order not to confuse and multiply the dif fi culties, we are considering here in this precise place only perfect expressions, that is, the ones for which the “Bedeutungsintention” is “ful fi lled.” We are authorized to do this insofar as this fullness, as we shall see, is the   telos   and the achievement of what Husserl wants here to isolate under the name of wanting-to-say and expression. Non- ful fi llment will bring to the surface originary problems to which we shall return below. Let us cite the passage which supports what we were just saying: “But if we re fl ect on the relation of expression and   Bedeutung,   and to this end break up our complex, intimately uni fi ed lived- experience of the expression ful fi lled with sense, into the two factors of word and sense, the word\n\ncomes before us intrinsically indifferent, whereas the sense seems the thing aimed at by the verbal sign, and meant by its means: the expression seems to direct interest away from itself towards its sense [ von sich ab und auf den Sinn hinzulenken ], and to refer [ hinzuzeigen ] to the latter. But this reference [ Hinzeigen ] is not an indication [ das Anzeigen ] in the sense previously discussed. The existence [ Dasein ] of the sign neither ‘motivates’ the existence of the meaning, nor, properly expressed, our conviction in the existence of the   Bedeutung.   What we are to use as an indication [the distinctive sign] must be perceived by us as existent [ als daseiend ]. This holds also of expressions used in communicative discourse, but not for expressions used in solitary discourse” (First Logical Investigation, §8). [r] Cf. §90 and the entire chapter 4 of part 3, in particular §99, 109, 111, and especially 112: “This will only be changed when there will be more extensive practice in genuine phenomenological analysis than heretofore has been the case. As long as one deals with lived-experiences as ‘contents’ or as psychical ‘elements’ which are still regarded as bits of things [ Sächelchen ] despite all the fashionable arguments against atomizing and physicalizing psychology, as long as one believes that he has found, accordingly, the distinction between ‘sensation-contents’ and corresponding ‘fantasy- contents’ only in the material traits of ‘intensity,’ ‘fullness,’ or the like, there can be no improvement. One must   fi rst learn to see that at issue here is a difference pertaining to consciousness.” <Translator: The equivalent passage can be found on pages 262–63 of the Kersten English translation.> The phenomenological originality that Husserl wants thus to respect leads him to posit an absolute heterogeneity between perception or originary presentation ( Gegenwärtigung, Präsentation ) and re- presentation   or   representative   re-production,   which   we   also   translate   by   presenti fi cation ( Vergegenwärtigung ). Memory, the image, the sign are re-presentations in this sense. Truly, Husserl is not   led   to acknowledge this heterogeneity. This heterogeneity constitutes the whole possibility of phenomenology which makes sense only if a pure and originary presentation is possible and original. Therefore, although we cannot study here directly the complex and fundamental system of such a distinction (to which we must add, at the least, the distinction between positional [ setzende ] re- presentation and imaginary re-presentation [ Phantasie-Vergegenwärtigung ] which is neutral in this regard), it is therefore the indispensable instrument for a criticism of classical psychology, and in particular for a criticism of the classical psychology of the imagination and of the sign. But, is it not the case that we are able to take this criticism of naive psychology only up to a certain point? And are we not able to show   fi nally that the theme and value of “pure presentation,” of originary and pure perception, of full and simple presence, etc., constitute the complicity of phenomenology with classical psychology, their common metaphysical presupposition? By asserting that   perception does not exist   or that what we call perception is not originary, and that in a certain way everything “begins” by means of “re-presentation” (this is a proposition which obviously can be sustained only within the erasure of these last two concepts; this proposition means that there is no “beginning” and the “re-presentation” of which we are speaking is not the modi fi cation of a “re” that has   supervened  upon an originary presentation), by re-inserting the difference of the “sign” in the heart of the “originary,” what is at issue is not to turn back away from transcendental phenomenology—and it does not matter whether this turning back would be toward an “empiricism” or toward a “Kantian” critique of the claim to an originary intuition. In this way we have just designated the primary intention—and the distant horizon—of the present essay. [s] It is necessary to put the following passage of the   Course in General Linguistics   side by side with the text of the   Logical Investigations:   “The linguistic sign is not a link between a thing and a name, but between a concept and an acoustic image. The acoustic image is not actually a sound; for a sound is something physical. The acoustic image is the hearer’s psychological impression of a sound, a representation as given to him by the evidence of his senses. The acoustic image may be called a ‘material’ element only in that it is the representation of our sensory impression. The acoustic image\n\nmay thus be distinguished from the other element associated with it in a linguistic sign. This other element is generally of a more abstract kind: the concept. The psychological nature of our acoustic images becomes clear when we consider our own linguistic activity.   Without moving either lips or tongue, we can speak to ourselves or recite silently a piece of verse ” ( Course in General Linguistics,  page 66; my italics). And Saussure adds this warning that we have really quickly forgotten: “We grasp the words of a language as acoustic images. That is why it is best to avoid referring to them as composed of the ‘phonemes’ that make up the words. Such a term, implying the activity of the vocal apparatus, is appropriate to the spoken word, to the realization of the inner image in discourse.” This warning has been forgotten, but this is probably so because the proposition that Saussure advances as a replacement only aggravates the risk: “Speaking of the   sounds   and   syllables   of a word need not give rise to any misunderstanding, provided that one always bears in mind that the names refer to the acoustic image.” We must of course acknowledge that it is easier to remember that warning when we speak of the phoneme than when we speak of the sound. The sound is thought outside of any real vocal activity only insofar as we situate it as an object in nature, and this situating in nature is done more easily with the sound than with the phoneme. In order to avoid these misunderstandings, Saussure concludes in this way: “The ambiguity would be removed if these three notions in question were designated by terms which are related but contrasted. We propose to keep the term   sign   to designate the whole, but to replace   concept   and  acoustic image   respectively by   signi fi ed   and   signi fi er ” ( Course in General Linguistics,   page 67). We could   posit   the   equivalence   signi fi er/expression,   signi fi ed/ Bedeutung,   if   the   structure  bedeuten / Bedeutung /sense/object were not a lot more complex in Husserl than in Saussure. Also it would be necessary to compare systematically the operation to which Husserl proceeds in the First Logical Investigation to the delimitation by Saussure of the “internal system” of language. [t] Concerning the non-reality of the noema in the case of the image and the sign, see, in particular,   Ideas I,   §102.\n\n4  Meaning and Representation  <53> Let us recall the objective and nerve of this demonstration: the pure function   of   expression   and   of   meaning   < vouloir-dire >   lies   not   in communicating, informing, manifesting, that is, not in indicating. Now, the “solitary life of the soul” would prove that this kind of expression without indication is possible. In solitary discourse, the subject learns nothing about himself,   manifests   nothing   to   himself.   In   order   to   sustain   this demonstration, whose consequences will be limitless in phenomenology, Husserl appeals to two types of arguments. 1. In internal discourse, I communicate nothing to myself. I indicate nothing to myself. I can at most imagine myself doing that, I can merely represent myself as manifesting something to myself. Here we have only a  representation   and an   imagination.  2. In internal discourse, I communicate nothing to myself and I can only pretend to,   because I have no need to communicate anything to myself.  Such an operation—communication from self to self—cannot take place because it would make no sense. And it would make no sense because it would have   no purpose.   The existence of psychical acts does not have to be indicated (recall that only an existence can in general be indicated) because the existence of psychical acts is immediately present to the subject in the present instant. <54> Let us   fi rst read the paragraph that ties together the   two arguments:  One of course   speaks,   in a certain sense, even in solitary discourse, and it is certainly possible to think of oneself as speaking, and even as speaking to oneself, as, for example, when someone says to himself: “you have gone wrong, you can’t go on like that.” But in the genuine sense of communication, there is no speech in such cases, nor does one tell oneself anything: one merely represents oneself [ man stellt sich vor ] as speaking and communicating. In a monologue words can perform no function of indicating the existence [ Dasein ] of psychic acts, since such indication would there be quite purposeless [ ganz zwecklos wäre ]. For the acts in question are themselves lived by us at that very instant [ im selben Augenblick ]. 1  These assertions raise very diverse questions. But they concern the entire\n\nstatus   of   representation   in   language.   Here   we   have   to   consider representation in the general sense of   Vorstellung,   but also in the sense of re-presentation   as   the   repetition   or   reproduction   of   presentation,   as  Vergegenwärtigung   modifying   Präsentation   or   Gegenwärtigung.   Finally we have to consider the sense of a representative taking the place of, occupying the   place   of   another   Vorstellung   ( Repräsentation,   Repräsentant, Stellverstreter ). [u] 2  Let us   fi rst consider the   fi rst argument.   In monologue, we communicate nothing to ourselves; one represents oneself ( man stellt sich vor ) as being a speaking and communicating subject. Husserl here seems to apply to language the fundamental distinction between reality and representation. Between   actual   communication   (indication)   and   “represented” communication, there would be an essential difference, a simple exteriority. Moreover, in order to gain access to <55> internal language (in the sense of communication) as pure representation ( Vorstellung ), we would have to pass through   fi ction, that is, through a particular type of representation: the imaginary   representation   that   Husserl   will   de fi ne   later   as   neutralizing representation ( Vergegenwärtigung ). Can we apply this system of distinctions to language? First, we would have to assume that in communication, in the so-called “actual” practice of language, representation (in all the senses of this word) would not be essential and constitutive. We would have to assume that representation is only an accident added contingently onto the practice of discourse. Now, there are grounds for thinking that in language representation and reality are not added together here and there, for the simple reason that it is impossible in principle to distinguish them rigorously. And no doubt we must not say that that impossibility is produced   in   language. Language in general   is   that impossibility—by means of itself alone. Husserl himself provides us with the means to argue for that against him. In fact, when I,   actually,   as we say, make use of words, whether I do this for communicative purposes or not (let us place ourselves here prior to this distinction and in the case of the sign in general), from the start I must operate   (in)   a   structure   of   repetition   whose   element   can   only   be representative. A sign is never an event if event means an empirical singularity that is irreplaceable and irreversible. A sign that would take place only “once” would not be a sign. A purely idiomatic sign would not\n\nbe a sign. A signi fi er (in general) must be recognizable in its form despite and across the diversity of the empirical characteristics that can modify it. It must remain the   same   and be able to be repeated as such despite and across the deformations that what we call the empirical event makes it necessarily undergo. A phoneme or grapheme is necessarily always other, to a certain extent, each time that it is presented in a procedure or a perception, but it can function as a sign and as language in general only <56> if a formal identity allows it to be reissued and to be recognized. This identity is necessarily   ideal.   It   therefore   necessarily   implies   a   representation,   as  Vorstellung,   the place of ideality in general, as   Vergegenwärtigung,   the possibility of reproductive repetition in general, as   Repräsentation,   insofar as each signifying event is a substitute (of the signi fi ed as well as of the ideal   form   of   the   signi fi er).   Since   this   representative   structure   is signi fi cation itself, I cannot open up an “actual” discourse without being originarily engaged in an inde fi nite representativity. Perhaps someone will object to us that Husserl wants precisely to bring to light this exclusively representative character of expressivity by means of his hypothesis of a solitary discourse which would respond to the essence of discourse by dropping the communicative and indicative shell. This person might continue by saying that we have formulated our question precisely with Husserlian concepts. Of course. But the point is that Husserl wants to describe only the way that expression, and not signi fi cation in general, belongs   to   the   order   of   representation   as   Vorstellung.   Now   we   just suggested that representation as   Vorstellung   and its other representative modi fi cations are implied by every sign in general. On the other hand and especially, as soon as we admit that discourse belongs essentially to the order of representation, the distinction between “actual” discourse and discursive representation becomes suspect, whether the discourse is purely “expressive” or engaged in a “communication.” By reason of the originarily repetitive structure of the sign in general, there is every chance for “actual” language to be as imaginary as imaginary discourse and for imaginary discourse to be as actual as actual discourse. Whether what is at issue is expression or indicative communication, the difference between reality and representation,   between   the   true   and   the   imaginary,   between   simple presence and repetition has always already started to erase itself. Does not the maintenance of this difference—in the history of metaphysics and still\n\nin Husserl—respond <57> to the obstinate desire to save presence and to reduce the sign or to make it be derivative? And with the sign all the potencies of repetition? This is as well to live   in   the—assured, secured, constituted—effect of repetition, of representation, in the effect of the difference which snatches presence away. To assert, as we have just done, that in the sign   the difference does not take place   between reality and representation,   etc.,   amounts   to   saying   therefore   that   the   gesture   that sanctions this difference is the very erasure of the sign. But there are two ways to erase the originality of the sign, and we must be attentive to the instability of all these movements. They pass in fact very quickly and very subtly from one to the other. We can erase the sign in the classical way of a philosophy of intuition and of presence. This philosophy erases the sign by making it derivative; it cancels reproduction and representation by turning them into a modi fi cation that supervenes over a simple presence. But since such a philosophy—and in truth it is   the   philosophy and history of the West —has in this way constituted and established the very concept of the sign, this concept, at the moment of its origin and in the heart of its sense, is marked by this will to derivation and erasure. Consequently, to restore the originality and the non-derivative character of the sign against classical metaphysics is also, by means of an apparent paradox, to erase the concept of the sign whose entire history and entire sense belong to the adventure of the metaphysics of presence. This schema holds as well for the concepts of representation, of repetition, of difference, etc., as well as for their entire system. The movement of this schema will only be able, for the moment and for a long time, to work over from within, from a certain inside, the language of metaphysics. This work undoubtedly has always already begun. We would have to grasp what happens in this inside when the closure of metaphysics comes to be named. With the difference between real presence and presence in representation as   Vorstellung,   we   fi nd thus, by means of language, a whole system of differences drawn into the same deconstruction: 3   <58> the differences between the represented and the representative in general, the signi fi ed and the   signi fi er,   simple   presence   and   its   reproduction,   presentation   as  Vorstellung   and   re-presentation   as   Vergegenwärtigung.   This   happens because re-presentation has a presentation ( Präsentation ) as   Vorstellung   for its represented. In this way—against Husserl’s express intention—we come\n\nto make   Vorstellung   in general and, as such, depend on the possibility of repetition, and the most simple   Vorstellung,   presentation ( Gegenwärtigung ), depend   on   the   possibility   of   re-presentation   ( Vergegenwärtigung ).   We derive the presence-of-the-present from repetition and not the reverse. This claim is against Husserl’s express intention, but not without taking into account—as   will   perhaps   appear   later—what   is   discovered   in   his description of the movement of temporalization and of the relation to the other. Naturally, the concept of   ideality   must be at the center of this kind of problematic. The structure of discourse can only be described, according to Husserl, as ideality. There is the ideality of the sensible form of the signi fi er (for example, the sensible form of the word) which must remain the   same  and can remain the same only insofar as it is an ideality. Then there is the ideality of the signi fi ed (of the   Bedeutung ) or of the intended sense, which is to be confused neither with the act of intending nor with the object, since these last two cases might, as it may turn out, not be ideal. Finally, there is the ideality, in certain cases, of the object itself which then secures (this is what happens in the exact sciences) the ideal transparency and perfect univocity of language. [v] 4   But this ideality, which is only the name of the permanence of the same and the possibility of its repetition, does not   exist  in the world and it does not come from another world. It depends entirely on the possibility of acts of repetition. It is constituted by the possibility of acts of repetition. Its “being” is proportionate to the power of repetition. Absolute ideality is the correlate of a possibility of inde fi nite repetition. We can therefore say that being is determined by Husserl as ideality, that is, as repetition. Historical progress <59> always has for its essential form, according to Husserl, the constitution of idealities whose repetition, and therefore tradition, will be assured to in fi nity: repetition and tradition, that is, the transmission and reactivation of the origin. And this determination of being as ideality is really a   valuation,   an ethico-theoretical act which reawakens the originary decision of philosophy in its Platonic form. Husserl at times admits this; what he always opposes is a conventional Platonism. When he asserts the non-existence or the non-reality of ideality, he does this in order to acknowledge that ideality   is   according to a mode that is irreducible to sensible existence or to empirical reality, indeed, to their\n\nfi ction. [w]   By determining the   ontos on   as   eidos,   Plato was doing nothing else. Now—and here once again we have to articulate the commentary on the interpretation—this determination of being as ideality is merged in a paradoxical way with the determination of being as presence. This is the case not only because pure ideality is always that of an ideal “ob-ject,” standing over and against, being pre-sent in front of, the act of repetition—  Vor-stellung   being the general form of presence as proximity to a look—but also because alone a temporality, determined on the basis of the living present as its source, determined on the basis of the now as “source-point,” can secure the purity of ideality, that is, the openness of the repetition of the same to in fi nity. What does the “principle of all principles” <60> of phenomenology actually mean? What does the value of originary presence to intuition as the source of sense and evidence, as the   a priori   of   a priori,  mean? It means   fi rst the certainty, which is itself ideal and absolute, that the universal form of all experience ( Erlebnis ) and therefore of all life, has always been and always will be the   present.   There is and there will have never been anything but the present. Being is presence or the modi fi cation of presence. The relation to the presence of the present as the ultimate form of being and ideality is the movement by which I transgress empirical existence, factuality, contingency, mundanity, etc.—and   fi rst of all   mine.   To think presence as the universal form of transcendental life is to open me to the knowledge that in my absence, beyond my empirical existence, prior to my birth and after my death,   the present is.   I can empty it of all empirical content; I can imagine an absolute upheaval of the   content   of all possible experience, a radical transformation of the world. Doing this will not affect the universal form of presence about which I have a strange and unique certitude, since that form concerns no determinate being. It is therefore the relation to   my death   (to my disappearance in general) that is hidden in this determination of being as presence, ideality, as the absolute possibility of repetition.   The   possibility   of   the   sign   is   this   relation   to   death.   The determination   and   the   erasure   of   the   sign   in   metaphysics   is   the dissimulation of this relation to death which nevertheless was producing signi fi cation. If the possibility of my disappearance in general must be in a certain way experientially   lived   so   that   a   relation   to   presence   in   general   can   be\n\ninstituted, we can no longer say that the experience of the possibility of my absolute disappearance (of my death) comes to affect me, supervenes over an   I am   and modi fi es a subject. The   I am,   being experientially lived only as an   I am present,   presupposes in itself the relation to presence in general, to being as presence. The appearing of the   I   to itself in the   I am   is therefore originarily the relation to its own possible disappearance.   I am   means therefore originarily   I am   <61>   mortal. I am immortal   is an impossible proposition. [x]   We can therefore go further. Insofar as it is language, “I am the one who is” is the confession of a mortal. The movement that leads from the   I am   to the determination of my being as   res cogitans   (therefore as immortality) is the movement by which the origin of presence and of ideality snatches itself away within the presence and the ideality that it makes possible. The erasure (or the derivation) of the sign is thereby merged with the reduction from imagination. Husserl’s situation in regard to the tradition is ambiguous here. Undoubtedly, Husserl profoundly renews the problematic of   imagination.   And   the   role   that   he   reserves   for   fi ction   in   the phenomenological method indeed indicates that imagination is not in his eyes one faculty among many. Nevertheless, without neglecting the novelty and the rigor of the phenomenological descriptions of the image, we must notice the inheritance there. Although Husserl constantly emphasizes that, in contrast to memory, the image is a “neutralizing” and non-“positing” representation,   that   this   characteristic   gives   it   a   privileged   place   in “phenomenological” practice, all this does not call into question the general concept under which the image is classi fi ed with memory: “re-presentation” ( Vergegenwärtigung ), that is, the reproduction of a presence, even if what is produced   is   a   pure   fi ctional   object   of   that   presence.   It   follows   that imagination is   not   a simple “neutralizing modi fi cation,”   even if   it is neutralizing (“A very likely confusion must be guarded against, <62> namely the confusion between   neutrality-modi fi cation   and   imagination ”). 5  It also follows that its neutralizing operation comes to modify a positing re- presentation   ( Vergegenwärtigung ),   namely,   that   of   memory   (“More precisely stated: universally   imagination   is the   neutrality modi fi cation   of ‘ positing ’   presenti fi cation,   therefore of memory in the widest conceivable sense”). 6   Consequently,   if   it   is   a   good   auxiliary   instrument   for phenomenological neutralization, the image is not pure neutralization. It\n\nkeeps within itself the primary reference to an originary presentation, that is, to a perception and to a positing of existence, to a belief in general. This is why the pure ideality to which neutralization provides access is not   fi ctional. This theme appears very early [ y]   and it will constantly fortify the polemic against Hume. But it is not by accident that Hume’s thought more and more fascinated Husserl. The power of pure repetition that opens ideality   and   the   power   that   liberates   the   imaginative   reproduction   of empirical perception cannot be foreign to one another. The same holds for what they produce. Also, on more than one point, the First Logical Investigation is quite disconcerting in this regard. 1. First, it is disconcerting insofar as expressive phenomena in their expressive   purity   are   considered   representations   of   imagination ( Phantasievorstellungen ). 2. In the sphere of interiority which is thus opened by this   fi ction, we are calling the communicative discourse that a subject can contingently address to himself (“you have gone wrong”)   fi ctional. Calling it   fi ctional allows one to think that a non-communicative, purely expressive discourse can   actually  take place in the “solitary life of the soul.” 3. Thereby we assume that, in communication, where the same words, the same expressive kernels are at work, where <63> consequently pure idealities are indispensable, a rigorous distinction can be made between the  fi ctional and the actual, and then between the ideal and the real, and that, consequently, actuality comes to be put on like an empirical piece of clothing that is external to expression, just like a body on a soul. And Husserl really makes use of these notions, even when he emphasizes the unity of the soul and the body in intentional   animation.   This unity does not undermine the essential distinction since it remains always a unity of composition. 4. Within the pure, internal “representivity,” in the “solitary life of the soul,”   certain   types   of   discourse   could   actually   be   held,   as   actually  representative (this would be the case of expressive language and, let us say this already, purely objective, theoretico-logical discourse), while certain others are still purely   fi ctional   (these   fi ctions located in the   fi ction would be the indicative acts of communication between myself and myself, myself as another and myself as myself, etc.).\n\nIf we admit, as we have tried to show, that every sign in general consists in   an   originarily   repetitive   structure,   the   general   distinction   between  fi ctional usage and actual usage of a sign is threatened.   The   sign   is originarily worked over by   fi ction.   Therefore, whether we are dealing with indicative communication or expression, there is no sure criterion by means of which to distinguish between an external language and an internal language, and even if we grant the hypothesis of an internal language, there is no sure criterion for distinguishing between an actual language and a  fi ctional language. Such a distinction, however, is indispensable for Husserl in order to prove that indication is external to expression, and for all that this distinction governs. If we declare that this distinction is illegitimate, we foresee a whole chain of formidable consequences for phenomenology. What we just said about the sign holds thereby for the act of the speaking subject.   Husserl   was   saying   therefore   that   “in   the   genuine   sense   of communication, there is no speech in such cases, nor does one tell oneself anything: one merely represents [ man stellt sich vor ] oneself as speaking and communicating.” 7   That statement <64> leads us to the   second argument  that   Husserl   announced.   Husserl   must   assume   therefore   a   difference between   actual   communication   and   the   representation   of   the   self   as speaking subject such that the self-representation can come only to be joined onto the act of communication contingently and from the exterior. Now the originary structure of repetition that we just evoked in relation to the sign must govern the totality of the acts of signi fi cation. The subject cannot   speak   without   giving   to   himself   his   representation,   and   that representation is not an accident. We can therefore no more imagine an actual   discourse   without   self-representation   than   a   representation   of discourse without actual discourse. Undoubtedly this representivity can be modi fi ed, complicated, re fl ected according to the originary modes that the linguist, the semiologist, the psychologist, the theoretician of literature or art, even the philosopher will be able to study. These modes can be very original. But all of them presuppose the originary unity of discourse and the representation of discourse. Discourse represents itself,   is   its representation. Better, discourse is   the   self-representation. [z]  In a more general way, Husserl seems to admit that there can be a simple exteriority between the subject such as he is in his actual experience and what he represents to himself to be living. The subject would believe that he\n\nis saying something to himself and communicating something to himself; in truth he would do nothing of the kind. We might be tempted to conclude on this basis that, since consciousness is then entirely invaded by the belief or the illusion of speaking-to-himself, an entirely false consciousness, the truth of the experience would be of <65> the order of non-consciousness. It is the opposite: consciousness is the self-presence of the living, of the   Erleben,   of experience. The latter is simple and is never, essentially, affected by illusion since it relates only to itself in an absolute proximity. The illusion of speaking-to-oneself would   fl oat on its surface as an empty, peripheral, and secondary consciousness. Language and its representation would come to be added to a simple consciousness simply present to itself, to a lived- experience, in any case, which can re fl ect in silence its own presence. As Husserl will say in   Ideas I,   “Each lived-experience in general (each lived- experience actually alive, if we can say that) is a lived-experience according to the mode of ‘being present.’ Belonging to its essence is the possibility of re fl ection on the same essence in which it is necessarily characterized as  being   certain and present.” 8   The sign would be foreign to this self-presence, which is the foundation of presence in general. Because the sign is foreign to the self-present of the living present, we can say that it is foreign to presence in general, in what we believe to be able to recognize under the name of intuition or perception. For—and this is the   fi nal argument in this section of the   Investigations — if representation in indicative discourse is false, in monologue it is useless. If the subject indicates nothing to himself, this is because he cannot do it and he cannot indicate anything to himself because he has no need to do so. Since the lived-experience is immediately present to itself according to the mode of certainty and absolute necessity, the manifestation of the self to itself by means of delegation or the representation of an indexical is impossible because it is super fl uous. It would be, in all senses of the word,  without reason —therefore without cause. It would be without a cause because it would be without a purpose, “zwecklos,” as Husserl says. This   Zwecklosigkeit   of internal communication is the non-alterity, the non-difference in the identity of presence as self-presence. Of course, this concept of   presence   does not merely involve the enigma of the appearing of a being in absolute proximity to itself; it also designates the temporal essence of this <66> proximity, and this does not help to dispel the enigma.\n\nThe self-presence of lived-experience has to be produced in the present as now. And this is really what Husserl says: if “psychical acts” are not announced by themselves through the intermediary of a “Kundgabe,” if they are not to be informed about themselves through the intermediary of indications, this is because they are “experientially lived by us at that very instant [ im selben Augenblick ].” 9   The present of self-presence would be as indivisible as a   blink of an eye.  [u] See on this subject the note by the French translators of the   Logical Investigations  ( Recherches logiques,   vol. 2, part 1, p. 276) and that by the French translators of   The Phenomenology of the Consciousness of Internal Time   ( Leçons,   p. 26). [v] See on this subject “The Origin of Geometry,” and §5 of the introduction to the French translation. [w] The assertion implied by all of phenomenology is that of Being ( Sein ) as non-reality, non- existence, that of the   Ideal.   This pre-determination is the   fi rst word of phenomenology. Although it does not exist, ideality is nothing less than a non-being. Husserl says, “Each attempt to transform the being of what is ideal [ das Sein des Idealen ] into the possible being of what is real [ in ein mögliches Sein von Realem ] must obviously suffer shipwreck on the fact that possibilities themselves are ideal objects. Possibilities can as little be found in the real world as can numbers in general, or triangles in general” ( Logical Investigations,   Second Investigation, chapter 1, §4). <Translator: The equivalent passage can be found on page 243 of the English translation, volume 1.> Husserl also writes, “It is naturally not our intention to put   the being of what is ideal on a level with the thought-being of the  fi ctitious or the absurd   [ Widersinnigen ]” ( Logical Investigations,   Second Investigation, chapter 1, §8). <Translator: The equivalent passage can be found on page 249 of the English translation, volume 1; these are Husserl’s italics.> [x] Making use of the distinctions from the “pure logical grammar” and from   Formal and Transcendental Logic,   we have to specify this impossibility as follows. This proposition of course makes sense. It constitutes an intelligible discourse. It is not   sinnlos.   But within this intelligibility, and for the reason that we just indicated, this proposition is “absurd” (with the absurdity of contradiction— Widersinnigkeit ) and   a fortiori   “false.” But since the classical idea of truth which guides these distinctions has itself issued from this way of getting rid of the relation to death, this “falseness” is the truth itself of truth. Therefore, it would be necessary to interpret these movements by means of other, wholly other “categories” (if we can still call such thoughts “categories”). [ y] See in particular, the Second Logical Investigation, chapter 2. [z] But if the   re-   of this re-presentation does not say the simple duplication—repetitive or re fl ective—that   supervenes   over a simple presence (which is what the word “representation” has always   wanted to say ), then what we are approaching or advancing here concerning the relation between presence and representation must be opened up to other names. What we are describing as originary representation can be designated under this title only within the closure that we are attempting here to transgress, depositing in the closure, demonstrating in the closure contradictory or untenable propositions, attempting to produce securely insecurity in the closure, opening it up to its outside, which can be done only from a certain inside.\n\n5  The Sign and the Blink of an Eye  <67> The sharp point of the instant, the identity of lived-experience present to itself in the same instant bears therefore the whole weight of this demonstration. Self-presence must be produced in the undivided unity of a temporal present in order to have nothing to make known to itself by the proxy of the sign. Such a perception or intuition of the self by the self in presence would be not only the instance in which “signi fi cation” in general would not be able to have a place, it would also secure the possibility of an originary perception or intuition in general, that is,   non-signi fi cation   as the “principle of all principles.” And later, each time that Husserl would like to indicate the sense of originary intuition, he will recall that originary intuition is the experience of the absence and uselessness of the sign. [aa]  <68> The demonstration that concerns us occurs at a point in time earlier than   The   Phenomenology   of   Internal   Time-Consciousness.   And   for systematic as well as historical reasons, the temporality of lived-experience is not a theme of the   Logical Investigations.   However, given the point where we are in the   Logical Investigations,   we cannot avoid noting that a certain concept of the “now,” of the present as the punctuality of the instant, authorizes discretely but in a decisive way the entire system of “essential distinctions.” If the punctuality of the instant is a myth, a spatial or mechanical metaphor, a metaphysical concept inherited, or all of that at once, if the present of the presence to self is not   simple,   if it is constituted in an originary or irreducible synthesis, then the principle of Husserl’s entire argumentation is threatened. Here we cannot examine closely the admirable analyses found in   The Phenomenology of   Internal   Time-Consciousness,   analyses about   which Heidegger says in   Sein und Zeit   that they are the   fi rst, in the history of philosophy, to break with a concept of time inherited from Aristotle’s  Physics   and determined on the basis of the notions of “now,” of “point,” of “limit,” and of “circle.” 1   Let us, however, try to take from Husserl’s analyses some points of reference for the viewpoint that we are occupying.\n\n1. The concept of   punctuality,   of the   now,   of the   stigm ē ,   regardless of whether or not it is a metaphysical presupposition, still plays a role there that is major. Undoubtedly, no   now   can be isolated as an instant and pure punctuality. Not only does Husserl recognize it (“it belongs to the essence of lived-experiences that they must be spread out in this way, that lived- experience can never have in it an isolated punctual phase”), 2   <69> but his entire   description   is   adapted,   with   an   incomparable   suppleness   and perceptiveness, to the original modi fi cations of this irreducible spreading- out. Nevertheless this spreading-out is still thought and described on the basis of the self-identity of the now as a point, as “source-point.” The idea of   originary   presence   and   in   general   of   “beginning,”   the   “absolute beginning,” the   principium, [ab]   always refers, in phenomenology, to this “source-point.” Although the   fl owing of time is “indivisible into fragments that could be by themselves, and indivisible into phases that could be by themselves, into points of continuity,” the “modes of the   fl owing of an immanent temporal object have a beginning, a, so to speak, source-point. This is the mode of   fl owing by which the immanent object begins to be. It is characterized as present.” 3   Despite all the complexity of its structure, temporality has a non-displaceable center, an eye or a living nucleus, and that is the punctuality of the actual now. The “apprehension-of-the-now is as it were the nucleus of a comet’s tail of retentions,” 4   and “there is each time but a present punctual phase that is now, while the others link themselves to it as a retentional tail.” 5   “The actually present   now   is necessarily   something   punctual   and   remains   something   punctual   [ ein Punktuelles ] <70>; it is a form that persists while the matter is always new.” 6  It is to this self-identity of the actual current now that Husserl is referring with the “im selben Augenblick,” with which we started. Moreover, there is no possible objection, within philosophy, in regard to this privilege of the present-now.   This   privilege   de fi nes   the   very   element   of   philosophical thought. It is   evidentness   itself, conscious thought itself. It governs every possible concept of truth and of sense. We cannot raise suspicions about it without beginning to enucleate consciousness itself from an elsewhere of philosophy which takes away from discourse all possible   security   and every possible   foundation . And it is really around the privilege of the actual\n\npresent, of the now, that, in the last analysis, this debate, which resembles no other, is played out between philosophy, which is always a philosophy of presence,   and   a   thought   of   non-presence,   which   is   not   inevitably   its opposite nor necessarily a meditation on negative absence, or even a theory of non-presence   as   unconscious. The domination of the now is not only systematic with the founding opposition of metaphysics, namely, that of   form   (or   eidos   or idea) and  matter   as the opposition of   actuality   and   potentiality   (“The actually present now is necessarily and remains something punctual: it is a form that persists [ Verharrende ] while the matter is always new”). 7   It secures the tradition that continues   the   Greek   metaphysics   of   presence   into   the   “modern” metaphysics of presence as self-consciousness, the metaphysics of the idea as   representation   ( Vorstellung ).   It   therefore   prescribes   the   place   of   a problematic that puts phenomenology into confrontation with every thought of non-consciousness that would know how to approach the genuine stakes and profound agency where the decision is made: the concept of time. It is not by chance that   The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness  <71> con fi rms the domination of the present and rejects at once the “after- the-fact” way that an “unconscious content” becomes conscious, that is, the structure of temporality implied by all of Freud’s texts. [ac]   In fact, Husserl writes,  It is a genuine absurdity to speak of an “unconscious” content that becomes conscious after the fact [ nachträglich ]. Consciousness [ Bewußtsein ] is necessarily being-conscious [ bewußtsein ] in each of its phases. Just as the retentional phase is conscious of the preceding phase, without making it an object, what is originarily given is already conscious—and under the speci fi c form of the “now”—without being objective. . . . The retention of an unconscious content is impossible. . . . If each “content” is in itself and necessarily “originarily conscious,” it would be absurd to question one about a consciousness that would be given to it later.[ad]  2. Despite this motive for the punctual now as the “archi-form” ( Urform ) ( Ideas   I )   of   consciousness,   the   content   of   the   description   in   The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness   and elsewhere forbids us from speaking of a simple self-identity of the present. We thereby   fi nd shaken   not   only   what   we   could   call   the   metaphysical   security   par excellence,   but   also,   more   locally,   the   argument   of   the   “im   selben Augenblick” found in the   Logical Investigations.  All of   The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness,   in its critical\n\nwork as well as in its descriptive work, demonstrates and con fi rms of course the irreducibility of re-presentation ( Vergegenwärtigung, Repräsentation ) to presentational   perception   ( Gegenwärtigung,   Präsentation ),   the irreducibility   of   secondary   and   reproductive   memory   to   retention,   of imagination to originary impression, and of the reproduced now to the actual current now, whether it is perceived or retained, etc. Without being able to follow here the rigorous way in which   The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness   proceeds, and without it being <72> necessary thereby to question the demonstrative validity of its treatment, we can still question its evidentiary soil and the   milieu   of these distinctions, question them   about   what   relates   the   terms   distinguished   to   one   another   and constitutes the very possibility of the   comparison.  We see very quickly then that the presence of the perceived present is able to appear as such only insofar as it is in   continuous composition   with a non-presence and a non-perception, namely, primary memory and primary anticipation (retention and protention). These non-perceptions are not added on,   do   not   accompany   contingently   the   actually   perceived   now; indispensably and essentially they participate in its possibility. No doubt Husserl says that retention is still a perception. But it is the absolutely unique case—Husserl has never spoken of another—of a perception whose perceived is not a present but a past as the modi fi cation of the present:  If we call perception   the act in which every origin resides, the act that constitutes originarily,  then   primary memory   is   perception.   For   it is only in primary memory that we see the past,   it is only in it that the past is constituted, and this happens not in a re-presentational way but on the contrary in a presentational way. 8  Thus, in retention, the presentation that gives us something to see delivers a non-present, a past and inactual present. We can therefore suspect that if Husserl nevertheless calls this perception, it is because he is holding on to the radical discontinuity as passing between retention and reproduction, between perception and imagination, etc., and not between perception and retention. This is the   nervus demonstrandi   of his criticism of Brentano. Husserl absolutely holds onto there being “absolutely no question of a continuous mediation of perception with its opposite.” 9  And yet, in the preceding section, was not the question of a continuous mediation posed in a really explicit way? Husserl says,\n\nIf we now relate the term perception with   the differences in the way of being given   which temporal objects have,   the opposite of perception   is then <73>   primary memory   and   primary anticipation   (retention and protention) which here comes on the scene, so that   perception   and  non-perception   pass   continuously   into one another. 10  And later, he writes,  In the ideal sense, perception (impression) would then be the phase of consciousness that constitutes the pure now, and memory, an entirely different phase of the continuity. But here we are only dealing precisely with an ideal limit, something abstract which can be nothing by itself. Nevertheless, even this ideal now is not something different   toto caelo   from the non-now, but on the contrary is in continuous commerce with it. And the continuous passage of perception into primary memory corresponds to that. 11  As soon as we admit this continuity of the now and the non-now, of perception and non-perception in the zone of originarity that is common to originary impression and to retention, we welcome the other into the self- identity of the   Augenblick,   non-presence and non-evidentness into the   blink of an eye of the instant.   There is a duration to the blink of an eye and the duration closes the eye. This alterity is even the condition of presence, of presentation,   and therefore   of   Vorstellung   in   general, prior   to   all the dissociations   which   could   be   produced   there.   The   difference   between retention   and   reproduction,   between   primary   memory   and   secondary memory, is not the difference—not the radical difference that Husserl would want—between   perception   and   non-perception,   but   between   two modi fi cations   of   non-perception.   Whatever   the   phenomenological difference might be between these two modi fi cations, despite the immense problems that the difference poses and the necessity of taking them into account, it separates only two ways of being related to the irreducible non- presence of another now. This relation to non-presence, once more, does not take by surprise, surround, or even dissimulate the presence of the originary impression; it allows its upsurge and its ever reborn virginity. But it radically destroys every possibility of self-identity in its simplicity. And that holds for the constituting   fl ow itself at its greatest <74> depth:  If we compare now the   constituting   phenomena to these constituted unities, we   fi nd a   fl ow,   and at each phase of this   fl ow is a   continuity of shading.   But in principle it is impossible to display any phase of this   fl ow in a continuous succession and therefore to transform in thought the   fl ow to such an extent that this phase is extended into identity with itself. 12\n\nThis intimacy of non-presence and alterity with presence cuts into, at its root, the argument for the uselessness of the sign in the self-relation. 3. No doubt Husserl would refuse to assimilate the necessity of retention with the necessity of the sign, since the sign alone belongs, like the image, to the genus of re-presentation and symbol. And Husserl cannot renounce this   rigorous   distinction   without   putting   the   axiomatic   principium   of phenomenology in question. The vigor with which he supports the idea that retention and protention belong to the sphere of originarity provided that we understand it in a “broad sense,” the insistence with which he opposes the absolute validity of primary memory to the relative validity of secondary memory, [ae]   these indeed manifest <75> his intention and uneasiness. He is uneasy   because   what   is   at   issue   is   to   save   together   two   apparently irreconcilable possibilities: (a) the living now is constituted as the absolute perceptual source only in continuity with retention as non-perception. The faithfulness to experience and to “the things themselves” forbids that the source be constituted in any other way. (b) Since the source of certainty in general is the originarity of the living now, it is necessary to maintain retention in the sphere of originary certainty and shift the border between originarity and non-originarity so that it passes, not between the pure present and the non-present, between the actuality and the non-actuality of a living now, but between two forms of re-turn or of the re-stitution of the present, re-tention and re-presentation. Without reducing the abyss that can in fact separate retention from re- presentation, without concealing that the problem of their relations is nothing other than the history of “life” and of life’s becoming-conscious, we must be able to say   a priori   that their common root, the possibility of re- petition in its most general form, the trace in the most universal sense, is a possibility that not only must inhabit the pure actuality of the now, but also must constitute it by means of the very movement of the différance that the possibility inserts into the pure actuality of the now. 13   Such a trace is, if we are able to hold onto this language without contradicting it and erasing it immediately, more “originary” than the phenomenological originarity itself. The ideality of the form ( Form ) of presence itself implies consequently that it can be repeated to in fi nity, that its return, as the return of the same, is to in fi nity necessary and inscribed in <76> presence as such; that the re-turn is the return of a present that will be retained in a   fi nite   movement of\n\nretention; that there is originary truth, in the phenomenological sense, only insofar as it is enrooted in the   fi nitude of this retention;   fi nally that the relation to in fi nity can be instituted only in the openness to the ideality of the form of presence as the possibility of a re-turn to in fi nity. Without this non-identity to oneself of so-called originary presence, how are we to explain that the possibility of re fl ection and of re-presentation belongs to the essence of every lived-experience? How are we to explain that re fl ection belongs as an ideal and pure freedom to the essence of consciousness? Husserl constantly emphasizes this for re fl ection in   Ideas I, [af]   and for re- presentation   already   in   The   Phenomenology   of   Internal   Time- Consciousness. [ ag]   In all of these directions, the presence of the present is thought   beginning   from   the   fold   of   the   return,   beginning   from   the movement of repetition and not the reverse. Does not the fact that this fold in   presence   or   in   self-presence   is   irreducible,   that   this   trace   or   this différance is always older than presence and obtains for it its openness, forbid us from speaking of a simple self-identity “im selben Augenblick”? Does not this fact compromise the use Husserl wants to make of the “solitary   life   of   the   soul”   and   consequently   the   rigorous   distribution between indication and expression? Is it not the case that indication and all the concepts from which we have attempted so far to think it (existence, nature, mediation, empiricity, etc.) have in the movement of transcendental temporalization an origin that cannot be uprooted? Likewise, is it not the case that all of what is announced in this reduction to the “solitary life of the soul” (the transcendental reduction in all of its stages and notably the reduction to the monodological sphere of the “ proper ”— Eigenheit —etc.) is not, as it were,   fi ssured <77> in its possibility by what is called time? It is  fi ssured by what has been called time and to which it would be necessary to give another title, since “time” has always designated a movement thought beginning from the present and since “time” can say nothing but the present. Must we not say that the concept of pure solitude—and of the monad in the phenomenological sense—is   split open   by its own origin, by the very condition of its self-presence: “time” rethought beginning from the différance in auto-affection, beginning from the identity of identity and non-identity in the “same” of the   im selben Augenblick ? Husserl has himself evoked the analogy between the relation to the alter ego such that it is constituted within the absolute monad of the ego and the relation to the\n\nother (past) present such that it is constituted in the absolute actuality of the living present ( Cartesian Meditations,   §52). Is it not the case that this “dialectic”—in all the senses of this word and prior to every speculative resumption of this concept—opens living to différance, constituting in the pure   immanence   of   lived-experience   the   hiatus   of   indicative communication and even of signi fi cation in general? We are indeed saying the hiatus of indicative communication   and of signi fi cation in general.   For Husserl intends not only to exclude indication from the “solitary life of the soul.” He will consider language in general, the element of the   logos,   in its expressive form itself, as a secondary event, and added on to an originary and pre-expressive stratum of sense. Expressive language itself would have to supervene on the absolute silence of the self-relation.  [aa] For example, the entire Sixth Logical Investigation constantly demonstrates that, between the acts and intuitive content on the one hand and the acts and the signifying contents on the other, the phenomenological difference is “irreducible.” See especially §26. And yet the possibility of a “mixture” is admitted there, and this mixture would raise more than one question. The entire  Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness   rests on the radical discontinuity between intuitive presentation and “the symbolic representation which not only represents the object in an empty way, but also the representation ‘through’ signs or images.” <Translator: Throughout this chapter, Derrida cites Dussort’s French translation of   The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness.   The equivalent passage for this citation can be found in appendix 2, on page 134.> In   Ideas I,   we can read, “Between   perception   on one side and   symbolic representation through image or sign   on the other, an unbridgeable eidetic difference exists. . . . We lapse into absurdity when we mix, as is done ordinarily, these modes of representation whose structures differ essentially, etc.”   Ideas I,   §43. <Translator: The passage can be found on page 93 of the Kersten translation.> And what Husserl says about the perception of the sensible, corporeal thing is how he thinks of perception in general, namely, that, being given in person in its presence, the sensible, corporeal thing is a “sign for itself” ( Ideas I,   §52 <Translator: The passage can be found on page 121.>). Isn’t it the case that being a sign of itself ( index sui ) is the same thing as not being a sign? In this sense, “at the very instant” it is perceived, the lived-experience is a sign of itself, present to itself without indicative detour. [ab] This is perhaps the right place to reread the de fi nition of the “principle of all principles”: “Enough of absurd theories. No conceivable theory can make us err with respect to the   principle of all principles:   that   every originary giving intuition is a legitimizing source [Rechtsquelle] of knowledge,   that everything that is offered to us   in “intuition” in an originary way   (so to speak in its corporeal reality)   must be simply received as what it gives itself out to be,   but   only within the limits in which it then gives itself.   Let our insight grasp this fact that the theory itself in its turn could not derive its truth except from originary givens. Every statement which does nothing more than give expression to such givens through merely unfolding their signi fi cation and adjusting it accurately is thus really, as I have put it in the introductory words of this chapter, an   absolute beginning,   called in a genuine sense to provide foundations, a   principium. ”   Ideas I,   §24. <Translator: The equivalent passage can be found on page 44 of the Kersten translation. The italics are Husserl’s.> [ac] See on this subject our essay, “Freud and the Scene of Writing,” in   Writing and Difference.\n\n<Translator: The essay can be found on pages 196–231. The phrase “after-the-fact” renders “après- coup,” which is the standard French translation of Freud’s “Nachträglichkeit.” In this essay, Derrida says, “Let us note in passing that the concepts of   Nachträglichkeit   and   Verspätung,   concepts which govern the whole of Freud’s thought and determine all his other concepts, are already present and named in the   Project [for a Scienti fi c Psychology] ” (p. 203). For a representative discussion of  Nachträglichkeit,   see   The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, Volume XII (1911– 1913), The Case of Schreber   (London: Hogarth, 1958), 67; here “Nachträglichkeit” is rendered as “after-pressure.”> [ad]   The   Phenomenology   of   Internal   Time-Consciousness,   appendix   9.   <Translator:   The equivalent passage can be found on pages 162–63. Here Derrida seems to have misread Husserl’s text. First, Husserl’s text twice states “Bewußtsein” and not, as Derrida’s translation implies, one time “Bewußtsein” (consciousness) and the second time “bewußtsein” (being-conscious). Churchill’s English translation says, “Consciousness is necessarily consciousness in each of its phases.” Then at the end of the citation Derrida seems to be using the Dussort translation of the original 1928 edition of Husserl’s lectures on time-consciousness. The 1928 edition (edited by Heidegger) has “unbewußt” (see page 473); thus the Dussort French translation states “inconscient” (see page 161). The later Husserliana volume X (page 119) has “urbewußt,” which is rendered by Brough as “primal consciousness”; see page 123 of   On the Phenomenology of the Consciousness of Internal Time   and note   18.   Churchill’s   English   translation,   which   is   also   based   on   the   1928   edition,   states “unconscious.” Here I have followed the corrected edition, which more clearly supports Derrida’s interpretation. My thanks to Rudolf Bernet who pointed this mistake out to me.> [ae] See, for example, among many other analogous texts, appendix 3 to   The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness:   “We have therefore, as essential modes of the consciousness of time: 1) the ‘sensation’ as presentation, and retention and protention interwoven [ ver fl ochtene ] essentially with it, but which can also become independent (the originary sphere in the large sense); 2) thetic re- presentation (memory), thetic re-presentation of what can accompany or return (anticipation); 3) imaginary re-presentation, as pure imagination, in which we discover all these same modes, in a consciousness   that   imagines.”   <The   equivalent   passage   can   be   found   on   page   142   of   The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness. > Here again, as we have noticed, the nucleus of the problem   has   the   form   of   the   interweaving   ( Ver fl echtung )   of   threads,   which   phenomenology painstakingly unravels in their essence. This extension of the sphere of originarity is what allows us to distinguish between the absolute certainty attached to retention and the relative certainty dependent on secondary memory and recollection ( Wiedererinnerung ) in the form of re-presentation. Speaking of perceptions as archi- lived-experiences ( Urerlebnisse ), Husserl writes in   Ideas I:   “They have in their concretion, more precisely considered, only   one,   but also always a continuously   fl owing,   absolutely originary   phase— the moment of the living   now. ” He goes on, “Thus, for example, we seize upon   the absolute validity  of re fl ection   insofar as   it is immanent   perception,   that is, pure and simple immanent perception, and more particularly, with respect to what, in its   fl owing away, it actually makes given originarily; similarly, the   absolute validity of retention of something immanent   with respect to what is intended in it in the characteristic of what is ‘still’ living and what has ‘just now’ been, but of course only so far as the content of what is thus characterized reaches. . . . We likewise seize upon the   relative   validity of recollection of something immanent” ( Ideas I,   §78). <Translator: The equivalent passages can be found on pages 180–81 of the Kersten translation. The emphasis is Husserl’s.> [af] In particular, see §77, where he raises the problem of the difference and of the relations between re fl ection and re-presentation, for example, in secondary memory. [ ag] See, for example, §42: “But the ideal possibility of an exactly matching re-presentation   of  this consciousness corresponds to every present and presenting consciousness.” <Translator: The\n\nequivalent   passage   can   be   found   on   page   115   of   The   Phenomenology   of   Internal   Time- Consciousness. >\n\n6  The Voice That Keeps Silent  <78> Phenomenological “silence” can therefore be reconstituted only by a double exclusion or a double reduction: that of the relation to the other in me in indicative communication, and that of expression as a later stratum, superior to and external to the stratum of sense. The agency of the voice will make its strange authority be heard in the relation between these two exclusions. Let us at the outset consider the   fi rst reduction, in the form in which it is announced in the “essential distinctions,” to which we have taken as a rule to hold ourselves here. Indeed, it is necessary to recognize that the criterion of the distinction between expression and indication is in the end entrusted to an all too summary description of “interior life”: in this interior life, there would be no indication because there is no communication; and there is no communication because there is no   alter ego.   And when the second person arises in interior language, it is a   fi ction, and   fi ction is only   fi ction. “You have gone wrong, you can’t go on like that” is only a false communication, a pretending. Let us not formulate   from the exterior   the questions which impose themselves upon the possibility and the status of such pretendings or  fi ctions, or upon the place from which this “you” in the monologue may arise. Let us not pose these questions   yet.   Their necessity will be still more keen when Husserl will indeed have to note that, besides the “you,” the personal pronoun in general and singularly the “I” are expressions that are “essentially occasional,” deprived of “objective sense,” and functioning always <79> as indexicals in actual discourse. The “I” alone achieves its meaning < vouloir-dire > in solitary discourse and functions outside of solitary discourse as a “universally operative indexical.” 1  For the moment, let us ask in what sense and in view of what the structure of interior life is here “simpli fi ed” and in what way the choice of examples is revelatory of Husserl’s project. It is revelatory at least in two features.\n\n1. These examples are of the   practical   order. In the propositions chosen, the subject addresses himself to himself as to a second person that he blames, exhorts, invites to a decision or to a regret. That proves, of course, that we are not dealing here with “indications.” Nothing is shown, directly or indirectly. The subject learns nothing about himself. His language refers to nothing that “exists.” The subject is not informed about himself; neither  Kundgabe   nor   Kundnahme   are functioning. Husserl needs to choose his examples within the practical sphere in order to show at once that in them nothing is “indicated” and that these consist of false discourses. In fact, we might be tempted to conclude from these examples, by supposing that we are unable to   fi nd another genus of them, that interior discourse is always essentially practical, axiological, or axiopoetic. Even when one says to oneself “you are this way,” is it not the case that the predication involves a valorizing or productive act? But it is precisely this temptation that Husserl wants above all and at all costs to avoid. He has always determined the model   of   language   in   general —indicative   as   well   as   expressive—by starting in the   theorein.   Whatever care he subsequently took to respect the originality of the practical stratum of sense and expression, whatever then has been the success and rigor of his analyses, Husserl never stopped asserting the reducibility of the axiological to its logico-theoretical nucleus.  [ah] 2   <80> We rediscover here the necessity that drove him to study language from a logical and epistemological viewpoint, pure grammar as pure   logical   grammar that is governed more or less immediately by the possibility of a relation to the object. A false discourse is a discourse, a contradictory   discourse   ( widersinnig )   escapes   from   non-sense ( Unsinnigkeit ), only if its grammaticality does not forbid a meaning or an intention-of- Bedeutung,   which itself can be determined only as the aim of an object. Therefore   we   must   notice   that   theoretical   logicity,   the   theorein   in general, governs   not   only   the   determination   of expression, of logical signi fi cation, but also already what is excluded from it, namely, indication, monstration as   Weisen   or   Zeigen   in the   Hinweis   or the   Anzeigen.   And it is remarkable   that Husserl must, at a certain depth, have recourse to an essential theoretical nucleus of indication in order to be able to exclude it from an expressivity that is itself purely theoretical.   Perhaps, at this depth, the determination of expression is contaminated by the very thing that it\n\nexcludes: pointing the   fi nger at what is in front of one’s eyes or at what must always be able to appear to an intuition in its visibility, the   Zeigen — the   relation   to   the   object   as   indicative   monstration— is   invisible   only provisionally.   The   Zeigen   is always an intention ( Meinen ) which pre- determines the profound essential unity between the   Anzeigen   of indication and the   Hinzeigen   of expression. And the sign ( Zeichen ) would always refer, in the last analysis, to   Zeigen,   to the space, to the visibility, to the   fi eld and horizon of what is ob-jected and pro-jected, to phenomenality as vis-à- vis and surface, evidentness or intuition, and   fi rst of all as light. What, then, of the voice and time? If monstration is the unity of gesture and perception in the sign, if signi fi cation is attributed to the   fi nger and to the eye, and if this attribution is prescribed to every sign, whether it is indicative or expressive, discursive or non-discursive, what do the voice and time have to do with it? If the invisible is the pro-visional, what do the voice and time have to do with it? And why does Husserl make such an effort <81> to separate indication and expression? Does pronouncing or hearing a sign reduce indicative spatiality or indicative mediacy? Let us be patient a bit longer. 2. The example chosen by Husserl (“you have gone wrong, you can’t go on like that”) must therefore prove two things at once. It must prove on the one hand that this proposition is not indicative (and therefore that it is a  fi ctional communication); on the other that it provides no knowledge of the subject to himself. Paradoxically, the proposition is not indicative because, insofar as it is non-theoretical, non-logical, and non-cognitive, it is as well not expressive. This is why it would be a perfectly   fi ctional phenomenon of signi fi cation. Thereby the unity of the   Zeigen   prior to its diffraction into indication and expression is veri fi ed. Now, the   temporal modality   of these propositions is not a matter of indifference. If these propositions are not propositions of knowledge, this is because they are not immediately in the form of predication. They do not utilize immediately the verb “to be,” and their sense, if not their grammatical form, is not in the present. They take note of a past in the form of a reproach, an exhortation to regret something and to make amends.   The present indicative of the verb “to be”   is the pure, teleological form of the logicity of expression; or, better, it is the present indicative of the verb   to be   in the   third person.   Even more, it is the type of proposition, “S is P,” in which the S is not a person for which we can\n\nreplace a personal pronoun, the latter having in all real discourse a value that is solely indicative. [ai]   The subject S must be a name and a name of an object. And we <82> know that for Husserl “S is P” is the fundamental and primitive form, the originary apophantic operation from which every logical proposition must be able to be derived by simple complication. [ aj] 3   If one posits the identity of expression and logical   Bedeutung   ( Ideas I,   §124), one must therefore acknowledge that the third “person” of the present indicative of the verb “to be” is the irreducible and pure kernel of expression. Husserl was saying, we recall, about an expression, that it was not primitively an “expressing itself,” but from the very beginning it is an “expressing itself about something” ( über etwas sich auszern,   see §7). The “speaking to oneself” that here Husserl wants to restore is not a “speaking-about-oneself- to-oneself,” unless the latter can take the form of a “speaking to oneself that S is P.” It is here that one must   speak.   The sense of the verb “to be” (about which Heidegger tells us that its in fi nitive form has been enigmatically determined by philosophy on the basis of the third person of the present indicative) 4  entertains with the   word,   that is, with the unity of the   phon ē   and sense, a relation that is entirely singular. Undoubtedly it is not a “simple word,” since we can translate it into different languages. But as well it is not a conceptual   generality. [ak]   Since,   however,   <83>   its   sense   designates nothing, no thing, no being nor any ontic determination, since we encounter it nowhere outside of the word, its irreducibility is that of the   verbum   or of the   legein,   that of the unity of thought and voice in the   logos.   The privilege of being cannot resist the deconstruction of the word. “Being” is the   fi rst or the last word to resist the deconstruction of a language of words. But why is verbality merged with the determination of being in general as presence? And why the privilege of the present indicative? Why is the epoch of the  phon ē   the epoch of being in the form of presence, that is, in the form of ideality? It is here that one must   hear oneself.   Let us return to Husserl. Pure expression,   logical   expression,   must   be   for   him   an   “unproductive” “medium” that happens to “re fl ect” ( widerzuspiegeln ) the stratum of pre- expressive sense. 5   Its sole productivity consists in making the sense pass into the ideality of the conceptual and universal form. [al]   Although there are\n\nessential reasons why the sense is not completely repeated in the expression and why the expression involves dependent and incomplete signi fi cations (syncategoremes, etc.), the   telos   of complete expression is the restoration, in the form of presence, of the totality of a sense actually given to intuition. Since the sense is determined on the basis of a relation to the object, the medium of expression must protect, respect, and restore the   presence   of the sense,   at once as the being-in-front of the object   available to a look, and   as the proximity to oneself in interiority.   The   pre   of the   present ob ject now-in- front-of is an   against   ( Gegen wart,   Gegen stand) at once <84> in the sense of the   up-against   of proximity and the   over-against   of the op-posite. Now between idealization and the voice, the complicity is here unfailing. An ideal object is an object whose monstration can be inde fi nitely repeated, whose presence in the   Zeigen   is inde fi nitely reiterable precisely because, freed from all mundane spatiality, it is a pure noema which I can express without having, at least in appearance, to pass through the world. In this sense, the phenomenological voice, which seems to achieve this operation “in time,” does not break with the order of   Zeigen;   it belongs to the same system and brings its function to completion. The passage to in fi nity in the idealization of the object is uni fi ed with the historial advent of the   phon ē . 6  This does not mean that we are able   fi nally to understand what the movement of idealization is on the basis of a determinate “function” or “faculty,” concerning which we could know what it   is,   thanks to the familiarity of experience, the “phenomenology of one’s own body,” or an objective science (phonetics, phonology, or physiology of phonation). On the contrary. That the history of idealization, that is, the “history of spirit,” or history as such, is inseparable from the history of the   phon ē ,   this inseparability restores to the   phon ē   its enigmatic potency. In order to really understand that in which the power of the voice resides, and that in which metaphysics, philosophy, the determination of being as presence are the epoch of the voice as the   technical   mastery of object-being, in order to really understand the unity of   techn ē   and   phon ē ,   it is necessary to think the objectivity of the object. The ideal object is the most objective of objects; it is independent of the   hic et nunc   of events and of the acts of the empirical subjectivity who intends it. The ideal object can be repeated, to in fi nity, while remaining the same. Its presence to intuition, its being-in-\n\nfront-of for the look depends essentially on no mundane or empirical synthesis; the restoration of its sense in the form of presence becomes a universal and unlimited possibility. But its ideal-being is   nothing   outside of the world; it must be constituted, repeated, <85> and expressed in a medium that does not impair the presence and the self-presence of the acts that intend it: a medium that preserves at once the   presence of the object   in front of the intuition and the   presence to oneself,   the absolute proximity of the acts to themselves. Since the ideality of the object is only its being-for a non-empirical consciousness, it can be expressed only in an element whose phenomenality does not have the form of mundanity.   The voice is the name of this element. The voice hears itself.   Phonic signs (“acoustic images” in Saussure’s sense, the phenomenological voice) are “heard” by the subject who utters them in the absolute proximity of their present. The subject does not have to pass outside of himself in order to be immediately affected by its activity of expression. My words are “alive” because they seem not to leave me, seem not to fall outside of me, outside of my breath, into a visible distance; they do not stop belonging to me, to be at my disposal, “without anything accessory.” In any case, in this way, the phenomenon of the voice, the phenomenological voice, is   given.   Someone will object perhaps that this interiority belongs to the phenomenological and ideal side of every signi fi er. For example, the ideal form of a written signi fi er is not in the world, and the distinction between grapheme and the empirical body of the corresponding graphic sign separates an inside of phenomenological consciousness and an outside of the world. And that is true of every visible or spatial signi fi er. Of course. Nevertheless every non-phonetic signi fi er involves, right within its “phenomenon,” within the (non-mundane) phenomenological sphere of experience in which it is given, a spatial reference; the sense of “outside,” “in the world” is an essential component of its phenomenon. In appearance, there   is   nothing   like   that   in   the   phenomenon   of   the   voice.   Within phenomenological interiority, hearing oneself and seeing oneself are two orders   of   the   self-relation   that   are   radically   different.   Even   before   a description of this difference is sketched, we understand why the hypothesis of the “monologue” could authorize the distinction between indication and expression only by assuming an essential connection between expression and the <86>   phon ē .   Between the phonic element (in the phenomenological\n\nsense and not in the sense of intra-mundane sonority) and expressivity, that is, the logicity of a signi fi er   animated   in view of the ideal presence of a  Bedeutung   (which is itself related to an object), there would be a necessary connection.   Husserl   cannot   bracket   what   the   glossematicians   call   the “substance of expression” without threatening his entire project. 7   The appeal to this substance plays therefore a major philosophical role. Let us therefore attempt to interrogate the phenomenological value of the voice, the transcendence of its dignity in relation to every other signifying substance. We think and we are trying to show that this transcendence is only apparent. But this “appearance” is the very essence of consciousness and its history, and it determines an epoch to which the philosophical idea of truth, the opposition of truth and appearance, such as it still functions in phenomenology, belongs. We can therefore neither call it “appearance” nor name   it   within   metaphysical   conceptuality.   We   cannot   attempt   to deconstruct this transcendence without plunging in, and groping our way through inherited concepts, toward the unnameable. The “apparent transcendence” of the voice, therefore, is based on the fact that   the   signi fi ed,   which   is   always   essentially   ideal,   the   “expressed”  Bedeutung,   is immediately present to the act of expression. This immediate presence is based on the fact that the phenomenological “body” of the signi fi er seems to erase itself in the very moment it is produced. From this point on, it seems to belong to the element of ideality. It reduces itself phenomenologically and transforms the mundane opacity of its body into pure diaphaneity. This erasure of the sensible body and of its exteriority is  for consciousness   the very form of the immediate presence of the signi fi ed. Why is the phoneme the most “ideal” of signs? Where does this complicity between sound and ideality, or rather between voice and ideality, come from? (Hegel had been more attentive to this complicity than anyone else; and from the viewpoint <87> of the history of metaphysics, this is a remarkable fact that we shall interrogate elsewhere). 8   When I speak, it belongs to the phenomenological essence of this operation that   I hear myself during the time   that I speak. The signi fi er that is animated by my breath and by the intention of signi fi cation (in Husserlian language the expression animated by the   Bedeutungsintention ) is absolutely close to me. The living act, the act that gives life, the   Lebendigkeit   that animates the body of the signi fi er and transforms it into an expression that wants to say,\n\nthe soul of language, seems not to separate itself from itself, from its presence to itself. The soul of language does not risk death in the body of a signi fi er abandoned to the world and to the visibility of space. The soul can  show   the ideal object or the ideal   Bedeutung,   which relates to it, without venturing outside of ideality, outside of the interiority of life present to itself. The system of   Zeigen,   the movements of the   fi nger and the eye (about which we were wondering earlier if those movements were not inseparable from   phenomenality)   are   not   absent   here;   they   are   internalized.   The phenomenon does not stop being an object for the voice. On the contrary, insofar as the ideality of the object seems to depend on the voice and thus becomes   absolutely available   in it, the system that connects phenomenality to the possibility of   Zeigen   functions better than ever in the voice.   The phoneme gives itself as the mastered ideality of the phenomenon.  This presence to itself of the animating act in the transparent spirituality of what it animates, this intimacy of life to itself, which has always led us to say that speech is alive, all of this assumes therefore that the speaking subject hears himself in the present. Such is the essence or the normalcy of speech. It is implied in the very structure of speech that the speaker   hear himself:   that he at once perceive the sensible form of the phonemes and understand his own intention of expression. If accidents arise, which seem to contradict this teleological necessity, either they are surmounted by some supplementing operation or there will be no speech. Being dumb and being deaf go together. The deaf can participate in colloquy only by slipping <88> his actions into the form of words whose   telos   entails that they are heard by the one who utters them. Considered   from   a   purely   phenomenological   viewpoint,   within   the reduction,   the   process   of speech   has the   originality   of being   already delivered as a pure phenomenon, having already suspended the natural attitude and the existential thesis of the world. The operation of “hearing- oneself-speak” is an auto-affection of an absolutely unique type. On the one hand, it operates in the medium of universality. The signi fi eds which appear in it must be idealities that we must   idealiter   be able to repeat or transmit inde fi nitely as the same. On the other hand, the subject is able to hear himself or speak to himself, is able to let himself be affected by the signi fi er that he produces without any detour through the agency of exteriority, of the world, or of the non-proper in general. Every other form of auto-affection\n\nmust either pass through the non-proper or renounce universality. When I see myself, regardless of whether it occurs because a limited area of my body is given to my look or it occurs by means of a specular re fl ection, the non-proper   is   already   there   in   the   fi eld   of   this   auto-affection   which thereafter is no longer pure. It is the same thing in the experience of touching-touched. In the two cases, the surface of my body, as a relation to exteriority, must begin by exposing itself in the world. Are there not, someone will say, forms of pure auto-affection which, in the interiority of one’s own body, do not require the intervention of any mundane exhibitive surface and yet are not of the order of the voice? But then these forms remain purely empirical; they cannot belong to a medium of universal signi fi cation. It is necessary therefore, in order to give an account of the phenomenological power of the voice, to specify this concept of pure auto- affection and describe what in it makes it proper to universality. Insofar as it is pure auto-affection, the operation of hearing-oneself-speak seems to reduce even the internal surface of one’s own body. In its phenomenon, it seems to be able to do without this exteriority within interiority, to do without this internal space in which our experience <89> or our image of one’s own body is stretched out. This is why hearing-oneself-speak is lived as absolutely pure auto-affection, in a proximity to self which would be nothing other than the absolute reduction of space in general. It is this purity that makes it apt for universality. Requiring the intervention of no determinate surface in the world,   producing itself in the world as an auto- affection   that is pure, it is an absolutely available signifying substance. For the voice encounters no obstacle to its emission in the world precisely insofar as it produces itself there   as pure auto-affection.   Undoubtedly this auto-affection is the possibility of what we call   subjectivity   or the   for-itself,  but without it no world would appear   as such.   For, in its depth, the voice assumes the unity of the sound (which is in the world) and the   phon ē   (in the phenomenological sense). An objective “mundane” science can surely teach us nothing about the essence of the voice. But the unity of the sound and the voice, which allows the voice to produce itself in the world as pure auto- affection, is the unique instance that escapes from the distinction between intramundanity and transcendentality; and by the same token, it makes this distinction possible.\n\nIt is this universality that results in the fact that, structurally and in principle, no consciousness is possible without the voice. The voice is being close to itself in the form of universality, as con-sciousness. The voice   is  consciousness. In colloquy, the propagation of signi fi ers seems to encounter no obstacle because it puts two   phenomenological   origins of pure auto- affection in relation. To speak to someone is undoubtedly to hear oneself speak, to be heard by oneself, but also and by the same token, if one is heard by the other, it is to make the other   repeat immediately   in himself the hearing-oneself-speak in the very form in which I have produced it. Repeat it immediately, that is, reproduce the pure auto-affection without the aid of any   exteriority.   This   possibility   of   reproduction,   whose   structure   is absolutely unique,   gives itself   as the phenomenon of an unlimited mastery or an unlimited power over the signi fi er, since the latter has the form of <90> non-exteriority itself. Ideally in the teleological essence of speech, it would therefore be possible that the signi fi er be absolutely near to the signi fi ed intended by intuition and guiding the meaning. The signi fi er would become perfectly diaphanous by reason of the absolute proximity of the signi fi ed. This proximity is broken, however, when, instead of hearing myself speak, I see myself write or signify by gestures. Husserl   will   be   able   to   consider   the   medium   of   expression   as “unproductive” and “re fl ective” precisely on the condition of this absolute proximity of the signi fi er to the signi fi ed, and on the condition of the signi fi er’s erasure in immediate presence. Also, on this condition, Husserl will be able, paradoxically, to reduce the medium with no harm being done and assert that a pre-expressive stratum of sense exists. On this condition too Husserl will give himself the right to reduce the totality of language, regardless of whether it is indicative or expressive, in order to regain the possession of the originarity of sense. How are we to understand this reduction of language in light of the fact that   Husserl,   from   the   Logical   Investigations   up   to   “The   Origin   of Geometry,” continues to consider there to be scienti fi c truths, that is, absolutely ideal objects, only in “statements”? How are we to understand this reduction when he continued to think of not only spoken language but also   inscription   as indispensable for the constitution of ideal objects, that is, of objects that can be transmitted and repeated as the same? First of all, one needs to recognize this: although the movement that\n\nresults in “The Origin of Geometry” was started long before, in its most obvious aspect it con fi rms the profound way in which language is limited to a   secondary   stratum   of   experience,   and,   in   the   consideration   of   this secondary stratum, it con fi rms the traditional phonologism of metaphysics. If writing completes the constitution of ideal objects, it does this only insofar as it is phonetic writing. [am]   Writing comes to stabilize, inscribe, <91> write down, incarnate a speech that is already prepared. And to reactivate writing is always to reawaken an expression within an indication, a word in the body of a letter which was carrying in it the threat of the crisis, insofar as the letter was a symbol that can always remain empty. Speech was already playing the same role in regard to the identity of sense such as it is   fi rst constituted in thought. For example, the “proto-geometer” must produce in thought, by means of a passage to the limit, the pure ideality of the geometrical object, by securing its transmissibility by speech and then entrusting it to a writing by means of which someone will be able to repeat the originative sense, that is, the act of   pure thought   which created the ideality of the sense. With the possibility of progress that such an incarnation authorizes, the risk of “forgetfulness” and of loss of the sense grows constantly. It is more and more dif fi cult to reconstitute the presence of the act that is buried under historical sedimentations. The moment of the crisis is always that of the sign. Moreover, despite the meticulousness, the rigor, and the absolute novelty of his analyses, Husserl always describes all of these movements in metaphysical conceptuality. The absolute difference between the soul and the body is what governs. Writing is a body that expresses only if we actually pronounce the verbal expression that animates it, if its space is temporalized. The word is a body that means something only if an actual intention animates it and makes it pass from the state of inert sonority ( Körper ) to the state of animated body ( Leib ). This body proper of the word expresses only if it is animated ( sinnbelebt ) by the act of a wanting-to-say ( bedeuten ) which transforms it into spiritual   fl esh ( geistige Leiblichkeit ).   But   only   Geistigkeit   or   Leiblichkeit   is   independent   and originary. [an] 9   As such,   Geistigkeit   needs no signi fi er in order to be present to itself. It is as much against its signi fi ers as thanks to them that   Geistigkeit  is awakened and maintained in life. Such is the traditional side of Husserl’s discourse. <92> But if Husserl had to acknowledge, even as salutary threats, the\n\nnecessity of these “incarnations,” this is because a profound motive was tormenting and contesting, from within, the security of these traditional distinctions. Because too the possibility of writing was inhabiting the inside of speech which itself was at work in the intimacy of thought. And here we return to all the resources of originary non-presence whose outcrop we have already located several times. Even though he represses difference by pushing it back into the exteriority of the signi fi er, Husserl could not fail to recognize its work at the origin of sense and of presence. Auto-affection as the operation of the voice assumed that a pure difference came to divide self-presence. The possibility of everything that we believe we   are   able   to   exclude   from   auto-affection   is   enrooted   in   this   pure difference: space, the outside, the world, the body, etc. As soon as we admit that auto-affection is the condition of self-presence, no pure transcendental reduction is possible. But it is necessary to pass through the reduction in order to recapture the difference in closest proximity to itself: not to its identity, nor its purity, nor its origin. It has none of these. But in closest proximity to the movement of différance. This movement of différance does not supervene upon a transcendental subject. The movement of différance produces the transcendental subject. Auto-affection is not a modality of experience that characterizes a being that would already be itself ( autos ). Auto-affection produces the same as the self-relation in the difference with itself, the same as the non-identical. Shall we say that the auto-affection about which we have been speaking so far concerns only the operation of the voice, that the difference concerns the   order   of   the   phonic   “signi fi er”   or   the   “secondary   stratum”   of expression? Shall we say that we can always reserve the possibility of a pure and purely self-present identity at the level that Husserl wanted to open up, the level of pre-expressive lived-experience, the level of sense insofar as it preceded   Bedeutung   and expression? <93> But it would be easy to show that such a possibility is excluded at the very root of transcendental experience. In fact, why is the concept of auto-affection imposed on us? The originality of speech, that by which speech is distinguished from every other milieu of signi fi cation, comes from the way its fabric seems to be purely temporal. And this temporality does not unfold a sense that would be itself timeless. Even prior to being expressed, the sense is through and\n\nthrough   temporal. The   omnitemporality   of ideal   objects,   according to Husserl, is only a mode of temporality. And when Husserl describes a sense that seems to escape from temporality, he hastens to specify that what is at issue in it is a provisional stage of the analysis and that he is considering a constituted temporality. Now as soon as we take account of the movement of temporalization, such as it is already described in   The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness,   it is indeed necessary to use the concept of pure auto-affection, the concept that Heidegger uses, as we know, in   Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics   precisely in regard to time. 10   The “source- point,” the “originary impression,” that on the basis of which the movement of temporalization is produced is already pure auto-affection. First, it is a pure production since temporality is never a real predicate of a being. The intuition of time itself cannot be empirical. It is a reception that receives nothing. The absolute novelty of each now is therefore engendered by nothing. It consists in an originary impression that engenders itself: “The originary impression is the absolute beginning of this production, the originary source, that starting from which all the rest is continuously produced. But it itself is not produced. It is not born as something produced, but   by   genesis   spontanea,   it   is   originary   generation.” 11   This   pure spontaneity is an impression. It creates nothing. The new now is not a being, is not an object produced, and every language fails to describe this pure movement except by means of metaphor, that is, by borrowing its concepts   from   <94>   the   order   of   objects   of   experience   that   this temporalization makes possible. Husserl constantly warns us against these metaphors. [ao]   The process by means of which the living now, producing itself <95> by spontaneous generation, must, in order to be a now, be retained in another now, must affect itself, without empirical recourse, with a new originary actuality in which it will become a non-now as a past now, etc.; and such a process is indeed a pure auto-affection in which the same is the same only by affecting itself with an other, by becoming the other of the same. This auto-affection must be pure since the originary impression is affected there by nothing other than by itself, by the absolute “novelty” of another originary impression which is another now. As soon as we insert a determinate being into the description of this “movement,” we are speaking by   metaphor.   We   say   the   “movement”   with   the   terms   for   what   the “movement” makes possible. But we have always already drifted into ontic\n\nmetaphor. Temporalization is the root of a metaphor that can be only originary. The word “time” itself, such as it has always been understood in the history of metaphysics, is a metaphor that indicates and dissimulates   at the same time   the “movement” of this auto-affection. All the concepts of metaphysics—in particular those of activity and passivity, will and non- will, and therefore those of affection or auto-affection, of purity and impurity, etc.— cover over and coincide   with the strange “movement” of this difference. But this pure difference, which constitutes the self-presence of the living present, reintroduces into it originarily all the impurity that we had believed we were able to exclude from it. The living present arises on the basis of its non-self-identity, and on the basis of the retentional trace. It is always already a trace. This trace is unthinkable if we start from the simplicity of a present whose life would be interior to itself. The self of the living present is originarily a trace. The trace is not an attribute about which we could say that the self of the living present “is originarily” the trace. It is necessary to think originary-being from the trace and not the trace from originary-being. This archi-writing is at work in the origin of sense. Since sense, as Husserl has recognized, has a temporal nature, it is never simply <96> present. It is always already engaged in the “movement” of the trace, that is, in the order of “signi fi cation.” Sense has always already exited from itself into the “expressive stratum” of lived-experience. Since the trace is the relation of intimacy of the living present to its outside, the openness to exteriority in general, to the non-proper, etc.,   the temporalization of sense is from the very beginning “spacing.”   As soon as we admit spacing at once as “interval” or difference and as openness to the outside, there is no absolute interiority. The “outside” insinuates itself into the movement by means of which the inside   of   non-space,   which   bears   the   name   “time,”   appears   to   itself, constitutes itself, and “presents” itself. Space is “in” time. It is the pure exiting of time to the outside of itself. It is outside-of-itself as the self- relation of time. The exteriority of space, exteriority as space, does not take time by surprise. Exteriority opens itself as the pure “outside” “in” the movement of temporalization. If we now remember that the pure interiority of   phonic   auto-affection   assumed   the   purely   temporal   nature   of   the “expressive” process, we see that the theme of a pure interiority of speech or of “hearing-oneself-speak” is radically contradicted by “time” itself.\n\nEven   the   exiting   “into   the   world”   is   also   originarily   implied   by   the movement of temporalization. “Time” cannot be an “absolute subjectivity” precisely because we are not able to think it on the basis of the present and on the basis of the presence to itself of a present being. Like everything that is thought under this heading and like everything that is excluded by the most rigorous transcendental reduction, the “world” is originarily implied by the movement of temporalization. Like the relation between an inside and an outside in general, an existent and a non-existent in general, a constituter and a constituted in general, temporalization is at once the very power and the very limit of the phenomenological reduction. Hearing- oneself-speak is not the interiority of an inside closed in upon itself. It is the irreducible openness in the inside, the eye and the world in speech. The phenomenological reduction is a scene. <97> Also, just as expression does not come to be added on as a “stratum” [ ap]   to the presence of a pre-expressive sense, the outside of indication does not come to affect accidentally the inside of expression. Their interweaving ( Ver fl echtung ) is originary. The intertwining is not the kind of contingent association that methodical care and a patient reduction could undo. Even as necessary as the analysis is, it encounters here an absolute limit. If indication is not added onto expression which is not added onto sense, we can nevertheless speak, in regard to them, about an originary “supplement.” Their addition comes to supplement a lack, an originary non- self-presence. And if indication, for example, writing in the everyday sense, must   necessarily   “add   itself”   onto   speech   in   order   to   complete   the constitution of the ideal object, if speech must “add itself” onto the identity of the object in thought, this is because the “presence” of sense and of speech has already begun to be lacking in regard to itself.  [ah] See notably chapter 4 and especially §114 to 127 of   Ideas I   (part 3). We will study them elsewhere more closely and on their own. See “Form and Meaning,” which has already been cited. [ai] See the First Logical Investigation, chapter 3, §26: “Every expression, in fact, that includes a  personal pronoun   lacks an objective sense. The word ‘I’ names a different person from case to case. . . . In its case, rather, an indicative function mediates and, so to speak, warns the hearer that the one who is in front of you aims at himself.” <Translator: The equivalent passage can be found on pages 218–19 of the English translation, volume 1. Here, Derrida indicates that he is using the French translation with a “tr. fr.”> The whole problem consists in knowing whether in solitary discourse, where, as Husserl says, the   Bedeutung   of the “I” is ful fi lled and accomplished, the element of universality proper to expressivity as such does not forbid this ful fi llment and dispossesses the\n\nsubject of the full intuition of the   Bedeutung   “I.” As well, we have to know if solitary discourse interrupts or merely   interiorizes   the situa-tion of dialogue in which, as Husserl says, “since each person, while speaking of himself, says ‘I,’ the word has the character of a universally operative indexical of this situation.” <Translator: The equivalent passage can be found on page 219 of the English translation, volume 1.> Thus we understand better the difference between the   manifested   which is always subjective and the   expressed   as   named.   Each time that the “I” appears, what is at issue is a proposition of indicative manifestation. The manifested and the named can at times partially overlap (“a glass of water, please” names the thing and manifests the desire), but the two are in principle perfectly disjunctive, as in the following example where they are perfectly disjunctive: 2 × 2 = 4. “This statement does not say what is said by ‘I judge that 2 × 2 = 4.’ They are not even equivalent statements, since the one can be true when the other is false” (First Logical Investigation, §25). <Translator: The equivalent passage can be found on page 313.> [ aj] See, in particular,   Formal and Transcendental Logic,   part 1, chapter 1, §13. [ak] Whether we demonstrate this in the Aristotelian way or in the Heideggerian way, the sense of being must precede the general concept of being. Concerning the singularity of the relation between the word and the sense of being, as well as for the problem of the present indicative, we refer to   Sein und Zeit   and to   Introduction to Metaphysics.   Perhaps it already seems that, while   fi nding support at decisive points in Heidegger’s motives, we would like to wonder whether, in regard to the relations between   logos   and   phon ē   and the claimed irreducibility of certain unities of words (of the word “being” or other “radical words”), Heidegger’s thought at times calls forth the same questions as the metaphysics of presence. [al]   Ideen I,   §124. <Translator: Here Derrida uses the German title, but perhaps it is a typographical error.> [am] It is strange that, despite the formalist motif and the Leibnizian   fi delity that he asserts from one end of his work to the other, Husserl has never placed the problem of writing at the center of his re fl ections, nor does he, in “The Origin of Geometry,” take account of the difference between phonetic writing and non-phonetic writing. [an] See the introduction to “The Origin of Geometry,” §7. [ao] See, for example, the admirable §36 of   The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness,  which demonstrates the absence of a proper name for this strange “movement,” which moreover is not a movement. “For all of that,” Husserl concludes, “names fail us.” We would still have to radicalize Husserl’s intention here in a speci fi c direction. For it is no accident if he still designates this unnameable as “absolute subjectivity,” that is, as a being thought by starting from presence as substance,   ousia, hypokeimenon:   a self-identical being in self-presence, the self-presence making a subject out of the substance. What is said to be unnameable in this section is not literally something about which we know that it is a being that is   present   in the form of self-presence, a substance modi fi ed into a subject, into the absolute subject, whose self-presence is pure and depends on no external affection, on no outside.   All of that is present and we can name it; its proof is that we cannot put into question the being possessed by absolute subjectivity.   What are unnameable, according to Husserl, are only the “absolute properties” of this subject, which is therefore indeed designated according to the classical metaphysical schema that distinguishes the substance (the present being) from its attributes. Another schema that keeps the incomparable depth of analysis within the closure of the metaphysics of presence is the subject-object opposition. This being for whom the “absolute properties” are indescribable is present as   absolute   subjectivity, is a being that is   absolutely   present and   absolutely   present to itself, only in its opposition to the object. The object is relative; the subject is absolute: “We are unable to express this in any other way than:   we describe this   fl ow in this way\n\naccording to what is constituted,   but it consists in nothing that is temporally ‘objective.’ This is absolute subjectivity, and it has the absolute properties of something that we have to designate metaphorically as ‘ fl ow,’ something that springs up ‘now,’ in a point of actuality, an originary source- point, etc. In the lived-experience of actuality, we have the originary source-point and a continuity of moments of retentions. For all of that, names fail us” ( The Phenomenology of Internal Time- Consciousness,   §36, my emphasis). <Translator: The equivalent passage can be found on page 100 of the Churchill translation.> Therefore the determination of “absolute subjectivity” would also have to be erased as soon as we think the present on the basis of différance and not the reverse. The concept of   subjectivity   belongs   a priori and in general   to the order of the   constituted.   This holds   a fortiori   for the analogical appresentation that constitutes intersubjectivity. Intersubjectivity is inseparable from temporalization as the openness of the present to an outside-of-itself, to an   other   absolute present. This outside-of-itself of time is its   spacing:   an   archi-scene.   This scene, as the relation of a present to an   other   present   as   such,   that   is,   as   non-derived   re-presentation   ( Vergegenwärtigung   or  Repräsentation ), produces the structure of the sign in general as “referral,” as being-for-something ( für etwas sein ) and radically forbids its reduction. There is no constituting subjectivity. And it is necessary to deconstruct all the way down to the concept of constitution. [ ap] In the important §124 to §127 of   Ideas I,   which we shall follow elsewhere step by step, Husserl invites us, while continuously speaking of a substratum of pre-expressive lived-experience, not “to expect too much from this image of strati fi cation [Sc hichtung ].” Husserl says, “Expression is not a sort of overlaid varnish or covering garment; it is a spiritual formation that exercises new intentional functions on the intentional substratum [ Unterschicht ].” <Translator: The equivalent passage from §124 can be found on page 297 of the Kersten translation of   Ideas I.   When Derrida says that he will follow these sections step by step elsewhere, he is referring to “Form and Meaning,” collected in   Margins of Philosophy. >\n\n7  The Originative Supplement  <98> Thus understood, supplementarity is really   différance,   the operation of differing that, at once, splits and delays presence, subjecting it by the same action to originary division and originary delay. Différance is to be thought prior to the separation between deferral < différer > as delay and differing < différer > as the active work of difference < différence >. It must be understood that différance is unthinkable starting from consciousness, that is, starting from presence, or starting simply from the opposite of presence, absence   or   non-consciousness.   It   is   also   unthinkable   as   the   simple  homogeneous   complication of a diagram or a line of time, as complex “succession.”   Supplementary   différance   vicariates   for   presence   in   its originary lack in regard to itself. We must now verify,   going through   the First Logical Investigation, in what way these concepts respect the relation between the sign in general (indicative as much as expressive) and presence in general.   Going through   Husserl’s text, that is, in a reading that can be simply neither that of commentary nor that of interpretation. Let us   fi rst note that this concept of originary supplementarity not only implies the non-fullness of presence (or in Husserl’s language, the non- ful fi llment of an intuition), it also designates this function of substitutive supplementing in general, the structure of the “in the place of” ( für etwas ) that belongs to every sign in general and about which at the beginning we were astonished that Husserl subjected <99> the possibility of this structure to   no   critical   question,   taking   its   possibility   for   granted   when   he distinguished between the indicative sign and the expressive sign. What we would like   fi nally to start thinking about is the fact that the for-itself of self- presence ( für-sich ), traditionally determined in its dative dimension as phenomenological, re fl ective, or pre-re fl ective auto-donation, arises in the movement of supplementarity as originary substitution, in the form of the “in the place of” ( für etwas ), that is, as we have seen, in the very operation of signi fi cation in general. The   for-itself   would be an   in-the-place-of-itself:  put   for itself,   in the place of itself. The strange structure of the supplement\n\nappears here: a possibility produces by delay that to which it is said to be added. This structure of supplementarity is very complicated. Insofar as it is a supplement,   the   signi fi er   does   not   fi rst   re-present   merely   the   absent signi fi ed. It substitutes itself for another signi fi er, for another signifying order, which carries on another relation with the missing presence, another relation that is more valuable owing to the play of difference. It is more valuable since the play of difference is the movement of idealization and because the more the signi fi er is ideal, the more it augments the potency of repetition of presence, the more it protects, reserves, and capitalizes on sense. In this way, the indication is not only the substitute that supplements the absence or the invisibility of the indicated. The indicated, as we remember, is always an   existent.   The indication also replaces another type of signi fi er: the expressive sign, that is, a signi fi er whose signi fi ed (the  Bedeutung )   is   ideal.   In   fact,   in   real,   communicative,   etc.   discourse, expression yields its place to indication because, as we recall, the sense intended by another and, in a general way, the lived-experience of another are not and can never be present in person. This is why, as Husserl says, expression then functions “as indication.” We still need to know now—and this is most important—in what way expression itself implies in its structure a non-fullness. Expression is known,   however,   as   being   fuller   than   indication   <100>   since   the appresentational detour is no longer necessary to it, and because it could function as such in the alleged self-presence of solitary discourse. In fact, it is indeed important to measure at what distance—at what articulated   distance—an   intuitionistic   theory   of   knowledge   governs Husserl’s   concept   of   language.   The   entire   originality   of   this   concept depends on the fact that its   fi nal subjection to intuitionism does not oppress what we could call the freedom of language, the outspokenness of a discourse, even if it is false and contradictory. One is able to speak without knowing. Against the entire philosophical tradition, Husserl demonstrates that speech then is still fully legitimate speech provided that it is obedient to certain rules which are not immediately given as rules of knowledge. Pure logical grammar, the pure morphology of signi fi cations, must tell us   a priori   under what conditions a discourse can be a discourse, even if it makes no knowledge possible.\n\nWe must here consider the   fi nal exclusion—or reduction—to which Husserl brings us in order to isolate the speci fi c purity of expression. This is his   most   audacious   exclusion.   It   consists   in   putting   out   of   play,   as “unessential components” of expression, the acts of intuitive knowledge that “ful fi ll” the meaning < vouloir-dire >. We know that the act of meaning, the one that gives the   Bedeutung  ( Bedeutungsintention ), is always the aim of a relation to the object. But it is enough that this intention animates the body of a signi fi er for that discourse to take place. The ful fi llment of the intention by an intuition is not indispensable. It belongs to the original structure of expression to be able to do without the full presence of the object aimed at in intuition. Evoking once   more   the   confusion   which   is   born   from   the   entanglement ( Ver fl echtung ) of relations, Husserl writes (in §9):  If we seek to plant ourselves   fi rmly in the soil of pure description, the concrete phenomenon of expression animated with a sense [ sinnebelebten ] is articulated, on the one hand, into a   physical phenomenon   in which the expression <101> is constituted according to its physical side, and on the other hand, into   acts   which endow it with the   Bedeutung   and contingently   intuitive fullness,  in which the relation to the expressed objective correlate is constituted. Thanks to these acts, expression is more than a simple   fl atus vocis.   It   intends   something, and insofar as expression intends something, it is related to something objective. 1  Fullness is therefore merely contingent. The absence of the intended object does   not   compromise   the   meaning;   the   absence   does   not   reduce   the expression   to   its   unanimated   and   in   itself   meaningless   physical   side. Husserl writes,  This objective something [to which the intention relates itself] can or indeed does appear as actually present [ aktuell gegenwärtig ] thanks to the accompanying or at least represented [ vergegenwärtig ] intuitions (for example in an imaginary form). In the case where that has taken place, the relation to the objective correlate is realized. Or else, when this is not the case, the expression functions with its charge of sense [ fungiert sinnvoll ], and is always more than a simple   fl atus vocis,   although it is deprived of the intuition that founds it, which provides it with an object. 2  The “ful fi lling” intuition is not therefore essential to the expression, to the intention of the meaning. The rest of this chapter is devoted to accumulating proofs of this difference between intention and intuition. Since all classical theories of language have been blind to the difference, [ aq] 3   they have been unable to avoid aporias and absurdities. These, Husserl marks out as he\n\nproceeds. Over the course of subtle and decisive analyses that we are unable to follow here, the demonstration is given of the ideality of the   Bedeutung  and of the non-coincidence between the   expression,   the   Bedeutung   (both insofar as they are ideal unities), and the   object.   Two identical expressions can have the same   Bedeutung,   meaning the same thing and yet having a different object (for example, in the two propositions “Bucephalus is a  horse ” and “This steed is a   horse ”). Two different expressions <102> are able   to   have   different   Bedeutungen,   but   intend   the   same   object   (for example, in the two expressions “The victor at Jena” and “The vanquished at Waterloo”). Finally, two different expressions are able to have the same  Bedeutung   and the same object ( Londres,   London,   zwei,   two,   duo,   etc.). Without such distinctions, no pure logical grammar would be possible. Consequently,   the   pure   morphology   of   judgments,   whose   possibility supports the entire structure of   Formal and Transcendental Logic,   would be forbidden. In fact, we know that pure logical grammar depends entirely on the distinction between   Widersinnigkeit   and   Sinnlosigkeit.   If it is obedient to certain rules, an expression can be   widersinnig   (contradictory, false, absurd according to a certain type of absurdity) while still having an intelligible sense that allows a normal discourse to take place, without becoming non- sense ( Unsinn ). It can have no possible object for empirical reasons (a golden mountain) or for   a priori   reasons (a square circle) while still having an intelligible sense, without being   sinnlos.   The absence of the object ( Gegenstandlosigkeit )   is   not   therefore   the   absence   of   meaning ( Bedeutungslosigkeit ). Pure logical grammar therefore excludes from the normalcy of discourse only non-sense in the sense of   Unsinn   ( Abracadabra, vert est ou ). 4   If we were not able to understand what “square circle” or “golden mountain”   means,   how could we come to a conclusion about the absence of a possible object? In   Unsinn,   in the a-grammaticality of non- sense, this minimum of understanding is denied to us. Following the logic and necessity of these distinctions, we might be tempted to support the idea not only that the meaning does not essentially imply the intuition of the object, but also that it essentially excludes the intuition.   The   structural   originality   of   the   meaning   would   be   the  Gegenstandlosigkeit,   the absence of the object given to intuition. In the fullness of the presence that comes to ful fi ll the aim of the meaning, intuition and intention fuse into one another; they “form a unity of intimate\n\n<103> merging [ eine innig verschmolzene Einheit ] that has an original character.” [ar]   This is to say that the language that speaks in the presence of its object erases or lets its own originality dissolve; it erases this structure that belongs only to it and that allows it to function   all alone   when its intention is severed from intuition. Here, instead of suspecting that Husserl begins the analysis with its dissociation too soon, we might wonder if he is not unifying too much and too soon. Is it not excluded, for essential and structural reasons—the very reasons that Husserl recalls—that the unity of intuition and intention are ever homogeneous and that the meaning fuses into intuition without disappearing? Is it not the case that we will never in principle be able,   in expression,   “to honor the draft drawn on intuition,” here taking up Husserl’s language? 5  Let us consider the extreme case of a “statement about perception.” Let us suppose that it is produced in the very moment of perceptual intuition. I say, “I see now a particular person by the window,” at the moment I actually see that person. What is implied structurally in what I am doing is that the content of this expression is ideal and that its unity is not impaired by the absence of the   hic et nunc   perception. [as] 6   The one who, next to me or at an in fi nite distance in time and space, hears this proposition must, in principle, understand what I intend to say. Since this possibility is the possibility of discourse, it must structure the very act of the one who speaks <104> while perceiving. My non-perception, my non-intuition, my   hic et nunc   absence are said by that which I say, by   what   I say and   because   I say it. Never will this structure be able to make with intuition a “unity of intimate merging.” The absence of intuition—and therefore of the subject of the intuition—is not only   tolerated   by the discourse, the absence is   required   by the structure of signi fi cation in general, were one to consider it   in itself.   The absence is radically required: the total absence of the subject and of the object of the statement—the death of the writer and/or the disappearance of the objects that he has been able to describe—does not prevent a text from “meaning” < vouloir-dire >. On the contrary, this possibility gives birth to meaning < vouloir-dire > as such, hands it over to being heard and being read. Let us go further. In what way is writing—the common name for signs that function despite the total absence of the subject, by means of (and beyond) his death—implied in the very movement of signi fi cation in general, in particular, in speech that is called “live”? In what way does\n\nwriting inaugurate and complete idealization, being itself neither real nor ideal?   Finally,   in   what   way   are   death,   idealization,   repetition,   and signi fi cation thinkable, in their pure possibility, only on the basis of one and the same openness? This time, let us take the example of the personal pronoun “I.” Husserl classi fi es it among the expressions that are “essentially occasional.” It shares this characteristic with a whole “group presenting a conceptual unity of possible   Bedeutungen,   such that it is essential for this expression to orient its actual   Bedeutung   each time to the occasion, to the person who is speaking, or his situation.” 7   This group is distinguished at once from the group of expressions whose plurivocity is contingent and reducible by means of a convention (the word “rule,” for example, means both a wooden instrument and a prescription), and from the group of “objective”   expressions   whose   univocity   the   discursive   circumstances, context, and situation of the speaking subject do not affect (for example, “all the expressions in theory, expressions out of which the principles and theorems, the proofs <105> and theories of the ‘abstract’ sciences are made up.” The mathematical expression is the model for this group). 8   Only these objective expressions are absolutely pure of indicative contamination. We are able to recognize an essentially occasional expression by means of the fact that we cannot in principle replace it in the discourse by a permanent, objective, conceptual representation without distorting the   Bedeutung   of the statement. If, for example, I tried to substitute for the word “I,” such as it appears in a statement, with what I believe to be its objective conceptual content (“whatever person who, while speaking, is designating himself”), I would end up in absurdities. Instead of “I am pleased,” I would have “whatever person who, while speaking, is designating himself is pleased.” Each time that such a substitution distorts the statement, we are dealing with an essentially subjective and occasional expression, whose function remains indicative. Thus indication penetrates wherever a reference in the discourse to the situation of the subject does not let itself be reduced, wherever the situation of the subject lets itself be indicated by a personal pronoun,   a   demonstrative   pronoun,   or   a   “subjective”   adverb   of   the following type: “here,” “there,” “above,” “below,” “now,” “yesterday,” “tomorrow,” “before,” “after,” etc. This massive return of indication into expression forces Husserl to conclude:\n\nAn essentially indicating character naturally spreads to all expressions which include these and similar representations as parts: this includes all the multiple forms of discourse where the speaker gives normal expression to something concerning himself, or which is thought of in relation to himself. All expressions for perceptions, convictions, doubts, wishes, fears, commands belong here. 9  The root of all of these expressions, as we see very quickly, is the zero- point of the subjective origin, the “I,” the “here,” the “now.” The   Bedeutung  of these expressions is carried off into indication each time that it animates a real discourse for others. But Husserl seems to think that for   the one who speaks   this   Bedeutung,   as the relation to <106> the object (I, here, now), is “realized.” [at]   Husserl says, “In solitary discourse, the   Bedeutung   of the ‘I’ is   realized   essentially   in   the   immediate   representation   of   our   own personality. . . .” Is this certain? Even if we assume that such an immediate representation is possible and actually given, does not the appearance of the word “I” in solitary discourse (a supplement whose reason for being is moreover not clear if the immediate representation is possible) already function as an ideality? Consequently, does not the appearance of the word “I” offer itself as able to remain   the same   for an I-here-now in general, keeping its sense even if my empirical presence is erased or is modi fi ed radically? When I say “I,” even in solitary discourse, am I able to endow my statement with sense in any other way than by implying in it, as always, the possible absence of the object of the discourse, in this case, myself? When I say “I am” to myself, this expression, as with every expression according to Husserl, has the status of being discourse only if it is intelligible in the absence of the object, in the absence of the intuitive presence, therefore in this case, in the absence of myself. Moreover, it is in this way that the   ergo sum   is introduced into the philosophical tradition and a discourse on the transcendental ego is possible. Whether or not I have the actual intuition of myself, “I” does express. Whether or not I am living, the words “I am” “mean” < veulent dire >. Here too the ful fi lling intuition is not an “essential component” of the expression. Whether or not “I” functions in solitary discourse, with or without the self-presence of the speaking being, it is  sinnvoll.   And one has <107> no need of knowing who is speaking in order to understand it or even to utter it. Once more, the border appears hardly certain between solitary discourse and communication, between the reality\n\nand the representation of the discourse. Does Husserl not contradict what he established in regard to the difference between   Gegenstandlosigkeit 10   and  Bedeutungslosigkeit   when he writes: “The word ‘I’ names a different person from case to case, and does so by way of an always new   Bedeutung ”? Do not discourse and the ideal nature of every   Bedeutung   exclude that a  Bedeutung   is “always new”? Does Husserl not contradict what he asserted about the independence of the intention and the ful fi lling intuition by writing: “What constitutes each time its   Bedeutung   (that of the word ‘I’) can be drawn only from the living discourse and intuitive givens that participate in it. When we read this word without knowing who has written it, we have a word, if not deprived of   Bedeutung,   at least foreign to its normal   Bedeutung. ” 11   Husserl’s premises should authorize us to say exactly the opposite.   Just as I do not need to perceive in order to understand a perceptual statement, I do not need the intuition of the object “I” in order to understand the word “I.” The possibility of this non-intuition constitutes the  Bedeutung   as such, the   normal Bedeutung   as such. When the word “I” appears, the ideality of its   Bedeutung,   insofar as it is distinct from its “object,” puts us in the situation that Husserl describes as abnormal: as if the word “I” were written by someone unknown. Only this situation allows us to account for the fact that we understand the word “I” not only when its “author” is unknown, but also when he is perfectly   fi ctional—and when he is dead. The ideality of the   Bedeutung   has here a value that is structurally testimonial. And just as the value of a perceptual statement depended on neither the actuality nor the possibility of the perception, the signifying value of the “I” does not depend on the life of the speaking subject. Whether   the   perception   accompanies   or   not   the   perceptual   statement, whether life as self-presence accompanies or not the statement <108> of the “I,” this is perfectly indifferent to the functioning of the meaning. My death is structurally necessary to pronouncing the “I.” Whether I am also “living” and whether I am certain about being alive, that comes over and above the movement of the meaning. And this structure is active. It keeps its original ef fi cacy even when I say “I am living” at the precise moment when, if that is possible, I have its full and actual intuition. The   Bedeutung   “I am” or “I am living,” or even “my living present is,” is what it is, it has the ideal identity proper to all   Bedeutung   only if it does not let itself be impaired by falsehood, that is, if I can be dead at the moment during which it functions.\n\nUndoubtedly, it will be different from the   Bedeutung   “I am dead,” but not necessarily from the   fact   that “I am dead.” The statement “I am living” is accompanied by my being-dead and the statement’s possibility requires the possibility that I be dead—and the reverse. This is not an extraordinary story by Poe, but the ordinary story of language. 12   Earlier, we gained access to the “I am mortal” from the “I am.” Here we understand the “I am” from the “I am dead.” The anonymity of the written “I,” the impropriety of the “I write”   is,   contrary   to   what   Husserl   says,   the   normal   situation.   The autonomy of the meaning in regard to intuitive knowledge, the autonomy that Husserl demonstrates and that we were calling earlier the freedom of language, “outspokenness,” has its norm in writing and the relation to death. This writing is not able to come as added onto speech because as soon as speech awakens writing has doubled it by animating it. Here indication neither degrades nor diverts expression; indication dictates it. We are drawing this conclusion from the idea of pure logical grammar, from the rigorous   distinction   between   the   intention   of   the   meaning ( Bedetungsintention )   which   can   always   function   “emptily”   and   its “contingent” ful fi llment by the intuition of the object. This conclusion is reinforced even more by the supplementary distinction, which is also rigorous, between the ful fi llment by the “sense” and the ful fi llment by the “object.” The former does not necessarily demand the latter, and we could draw the same lesson from a careful reading of §14 (“Content <109> as Object,   Content   as   Ful fi lling   Sense   and   Content   as   Simple   Sense   or  Bedeutung ”). Why does Husserl refuse to draw these conclusions from the same premises? The motive for full “presence,” the intuitionist imperative and the project of knowledge continue to govern—at a distance, let us say—the whole of the description. In one and the same movement, Husserl describes and erases the emancipation of discourse as non-knowledge. The originality of the meaning as an aim is limited by the   telos   of vision. The difference that   separates   intention   from   intuition,   in   order   to   be   radical,   would nevertheless be   pro-visional.   And, despite everything, this pro-vision would constitute the essence of meaning < vouloir-dire >. The   eidos   is determined in depth by the   telos.   The “symbol” always signals toward the “truth” whose lack it is constituted as:\n\nIf the “possibility” or the “truth” happens to be lacking, the intention of the statement is obviously achieved only “symbolically”; it cannot derive the fullness which constitutes its epistemological value from intuition or from the categorial functions which must be exercised in its foundation. It then lacks, as one says, a “true,” an “authentic”   Bedeutung. 13  In other words, the true and authentic meaning is the wanting to say-the- truth. 14   This subtle shift is the resumption of the   eidos   in the   telos   and of language in knowledge. A discourse may have already conformed to its discursive essence when it was false, but it nevertheless attains its entelechy when it is true. One can well   speak   by saying “the circle is square,” but one speaks   well   by saying that the circle is not square. There is already sense in the   fi rst proposition. But we would be wrong to infer from it that the sense  does not await   the truth. It does not wait for the truth insofar as it expects it; it precedes the   truth   only   as its anticipation.   In truth,   the   telos   that announces the achievement that is promised for “later” has already, earlier, opened up the sense as the relation to the object. This is what the concept of  normalcy   means each time that it intervenes in Husserl’s descriptions. The <110> norm is knowledge, the intuition that is adequate to its object, the evidence that is not only distinct but “clear”: the full presence of the sense to a consciousness that is itself present to itself in the fullness of its life, in the fullness of its living present. Also, without overlooking the rigor and the audacity of the “pure logical grammar,” without forgetting the advantages that it can offer if we compare it to the classical projects of rational grammar, it is indeed necessary to acknowledge that its “formality” is limited. We could say as much about the pure morphology of   judgments,  which, in   Formal and Transcendental Logic,   determines the pure logical grammar or pure morphology of   signi fi cations.   The puri fi cation of the formal is regulated according to a concept of   sense   that is itself determined on the basis of a   relation to the object.   The form is always the form of a sense, and the sense is open only in the epistemological intentionality of the relation to an object. The form is only the empty, pure intention of this intentionality. Perhaps no project of pure grammar escapes it, perhaps the  telos   of epistemological rationality is the irreducible origin of the idea of pure grammar, perhaps the semantic theme, as “empty” as it is, always limits   the   formalist   project.   Always   in   Husserl,   the   transcendental intuitionism   weighs   very   heavily   on   the   formalist   theme.   Apparently independent of the ful fi lling intuitions, the “pure” forms of signi fi cation are\n\nalways, insofar as they are “empty” or crossed out, regulated by the epistemological criterion of a relation to the object. The difference between “the circle is square” and “green is or” or “abracadabra” (and Husserl a bit quickly associates these last two examples and is perhaps not careful enough in regard to their difference) consists in the fact that the form of a relation to the object and of a unitary intuition appears only in the   fi rst example. This aim will always be disappointed here, but this proposition makes   sense   only because   another content,   being whispered in this form (S is P),   could   provide us with an object to be known and seen. The “circle is square,” an expression endowed with sense ( sinnvoll ), has no possible object, but it makes <111> sense only to the extent that its grammatical form tolerates the possibility of a relation to the object. The ef fi cacy and the form of signs that do not obey these rules, that is, that promise no knowledge, can be determined as non-sense ( Unsinn ) only if we have already, according to the most traditional philosophical gesture, de fi ned sense in general on the basis of truth as objectivity. Otherwise, we would have to throw away into absolute nonsense all poetical language that transgresses and does not let itself ever be reduced to the laws of this grammar of knowledge. Within the forms of non-discursive signi fi cation (music and non-literary arts in general) as well as in discourses of the type “abracadabra” or “green is or,” there are resources of sense which do not signal toward the possible object. Husserl would not deny the signifying force of such formations; he would simply not grant them the formal quality of expressions endowed with   sense,   that is, the formal quality of logic as the relation to an   object.   Recognizing this is to recognize the initial limitation of sense to knowledge, of the   logos   to objectivity, of language to reason. * * * We have put to the test the systematic solidarity of the concepts of sense, ideality,   objectivity,   truth,   intuition,   perception,   and   expression.   Their common matrix is being as   presence:   the absolute proximity of self- identity; the being-in-front of the object in its availability for repetition; the maintaining of the temporal present, the ideal form of which is the self- presence   of   transcendental   life   whose   ideal   identity   allows   idealiter  repetition to in fi nity. The living-present, which is a concept that cannot be\n\ndecomposed into a subject and an attribute, is therefore the founding concept of phenomenology as metaphysics. However, since all of what is   purely   thought under this concept is by the same token determined as   ideality,   the living-present is   in fact   really, factually, etc. deferred to in fi nity. This différance is <112> the difference between ideality and non-ideality. This is a proposition that we could have ascertained already at the beginning of the   Logical Investigations,   from the point of view that concerns us. Thus, after having proposed an essential distinction   between   objective   expressions   and   expressions   that   are essentially subjective, Husserl shows that absolute ideality can be only on the side of objective expressions. There is nothing surprising in that. But he adds   immediately   that   even   in   essentially   subjective   expressions,   the  fl uctuation is not in the objective content of the expression (the   Bedeutung ), but only in the act of meaning ( bedeuten   < vouloir-dire:   wanting-to-say>). This allows him to conclude, apparently against his earlier demonstration, that in a subjective expression, the   content   can always be replaced by an objective content which is therefore ideal. Only the act is then lost to ideality. But this substitution (which, let us note in passing, would still con fi rm what we were saying about the play of life and death in the “I”) is ideal. Since the ideal is always thought by Husserl in the form of the Idea in the   Kantian   sense,   this   substitution   of   ideality   for   non-ideality,   of objectivity   for   non-objectivity,   is   deferred   to   in fi nity.   Attributing   a subjective origin to the   fl uctuation, contesting the theory according to which the   fl uctuation would belong to the objective content of the   Bedeutung,   and would thus undermine its ideality, Husserl writes,  We shall have to look on such a conception as invalid. The content that the subjective expression orienting its   Bedeutung   according to the situation aims at is an ideal unit of  Bedeutung   in precisely the same sense as the content of a   fi xed expression. This is shown by the fact that, ideally speaking, each subjective expression is replaceable by an objective expression which will preserve the identity of each momentary   Bedeutung. Truly, we shall have to recognize that this substitution cannot be effectuated not only for reasons of practical necessity, for example, because of its complexity, but also that, to a large degree, it is not realizable in fact and even that it will remain   <113>   always unrealizable.   Clearly, in fact, to say that each subjective expression could be replaced by an objective expression is no more than to assert the  absence of limits [Schrankenlosigkeit] of objective reason.   Everything that is, can be known “in itself.” Its being is a being de fi nite in content, and documented in such and such “truths in themselves.” . . . But what is objectively quite de fi nite, must permit   objective   determination, and what permits objective determination, must, ideally speaking, permit expression through wholly\n\ndeterminate word   Bedeutungen. . . . But we are in fi nitely distant from this ideal. . . . Strike out the essentially occasional expressions from one’s language, try to describe any subjective experience in a univocal and objectively stable way: such an attempt of this kind is obviously vain. 15  “The Origin of Geometry” will take up in a form that is literally identical these propositions concerning the univocity of the objective expression as an inaccessible ideal.  In its ideal value, the whole system of the “essential distinctions” is therefore a purely teleological structure.   By the same token, the possibility of distinguishing between sign and non-sign, between the linguistic sign and the non-linguistic sign, expression and indication, ideality and non- ideality,   between   subject   and   object,   grammaticality   and   non- grammaticality, pure grammaticality and empirical grammaticality, pure general   grammaticality   and   pure   logical   grammaticality,   intention   and intuition, etc.: this pure possibility is deferred to in fi nity. Thereupon, these “essential distinctions” are gripped by the following aporia:   in fact, realiter,  they are never respected, and Husserl recognizes this.   In principle and idealiter,   they are erased since they only live as distinctions from the difference between principle and fact, ideality and reality. Their possibility is their impossibility. <114> But how does this difference give itself to be thought? What does “to in fi nity” mean here? What does presence as différance to in fi nity mean? What does the life of the living present as différance to in fi nity mean? That Husserl has always thought in fi nity as an Idea in the Kantian sense, as the inde fi niteness of a “to in fi nity,” that makes us believe that he has never   derived   difference from the fullness of a   parousia,   from the full presence of a positive in fi nite, that he has never believed in the achievement of an “absolute knowledge” as presence nearby to itself, in the   Logos,   in the achievement of an in fi nite concept. And what he shows us in regard to the movement of temporalization leaves no doubt on this matter: although he has not made “articulation” his theme, namely, the “diacritical” work of difference   in   the   constitution   of   sense   and   of   the   sign,   in   depth   he recognizes the necessity of doing this. And yet the entire phenomenological discourse is, as we have seen, gripped by the schema of a metaphysics of presence   which   relentlessly   exhausts   itself   trying   to   make   difference derivative.   Within   this   schema,   Hegelianism   seems   more   radical:   par\n\nexcellence   at the point where it brings to light that the positive in fi nite must be   thought   (which   is   possible   only   if   it   thinks   itself )   so   that   the inde fi niteness of différance may appear   as such.   Hegel’s criticism of Kant would no doubt also be valid against Husserl. But this appearing of the Ideal as in fi nite différance can only be produced in a relationship to death in general. Only a relationship to my-death can make the in fi nite différance of presence appear. By the same token, compared to the ideality of the positive in fi nite, this relation to my-death becomes an accident of   fi nite empiricity. The appearing of in fi nite différance is itself   fi nite. Différance, which is nothing outside of this relationship, thereupon becomes the   fi nitude of life as the essential relation to itself as to its death.   The in fi nite différance is  fi nite.   We are no longer able to think it within the opposition of the   fi nite and the in fi nite, absence and presence, negation and af fi rmation. <115> In this sense,   within   the metaphysics of presence, of philosophy as the knowledge of the presence of the object, as knowing’s being-nearby- itself in consciousness, we believe quite simply in absolute knowledge as the   closure   if not the end of history. We believe in it literally— and that such a closure has taken place.   The history of being as presence, as self-presence in absolute knowledge, as consciousness (of) self in the in fi nity of   parousia,  this history is closed. The history of presence is closed, for “history” has never meant anything but this: presentation ( Gegenwärtigung ) of being < l’être >, production and gathering of the being < l’étant > in presence, as knowledge and mastery. Since full presence has the   vocation   of in fi nity as absolute presence to itself in con-sciousness, the achievement of absolute knowledge is the end of the in fi nite which can only be the unity of the concept,   logos,   and consciousness in a voice without différance.   The history of metaphysics is the absolute wanting-to-hear-itself speak.   This history is closed when this absolute in fi nity appears to itself as its own death.   A voice without différance, a voice without writing is at once absolutely alive and absolutely dead.  As for what “begins” then “beyond” absolute knowledge,   unheard-of  thoughts are required, thoughts that are sought across the memory of old signs. As long as différance remains a concept about which we ask ourselves whether it must be thought from presence or prior to it, it remains one of these old signs. And it tells us that it is necessary to continue inde fi nitely to interrogate presence within the closure of knowledge. It is\n\nnecessary to hear it in this way and otherwise—otherwise, that is, within the openness of an unheard-of question that opens itself neither onto knowledge nor onto a non-knowledge as knowledge to come. In the openness of this question,   we no longer know.   This does not mean that we know nothing, but that we are beyond absolute knowledge (and its ethical, aesthetic, or religious system), approaching that on the basis of which its closure is announced and decided. Such a question will be legitimately heard <116> as   wanting to say nothing,   as no longer belonging to the system of wanting- to-say. We no longer know therefore whether what is always presented as the derived   and   modi fi ed   re-presentation   of   simple   presentation,   as   the “supplement,” as “sign,” “writing,” “trace,” “is” not, in a sense necessarily but in a new way a-historical, “older” than presence and the system of truth, older than “history”—“older” than sense and the senses, older than the originary donating intuition, than the actual and full perception of the “thing itself,” older than vision, hearing, touch, even before one distinguishes between their “sensible” literality and their metaphorical appearance in the scene of the entire history of philosophy. We no longer know therefore whether   what   has   always   been   reduced   and   abased   as   an   accident, modi fi cation,   and   re-turn   in   the   old   names   of   “sign”   and   of   “re- presentation” has not repressed what would relate truth to its own death as to   its   origin,   whether   the   force   of   Vergegenwärtigung   in   which   the  Gegenwärtigung 16   is de-presented in order to be re-presented as such, whether the force of repetition of the living present which re-presents itself in a   supplement   because it has never been present to itself, whether what we call the old names of force and différance, is not more “ancient” than the “originary.” In order to think this age, in order to “speak” of it, other names would be necessary than those of sign or re-presentation. And it is necessary to think as “normal” and pre-originary what Husserl believes he is able to isolate as a   particular,   accidental,   dependent,   and   secondary   experience:   the experience of the inde fi nite drift of signs as errancy and change of scenes ( Verwandlung ), linking the re-presentations ( Vergegenwärtigungen ) to one another, without beginning or end. There has never been perception, and “presentation” is a representation of representation that desires itself within representation as its birth or its death.\n\nEverything no doubt began in this way: “A name uttered in front of us makes us think of the Dresden gallery. . . . We wander <117> through the rooms. . . . A picture by Teniers . . . represents a picture gallery. . . . The pictures in this gallery represent again pictures which for their part would make visible inscriptions that we are able to decipher, etc.” 17  Nothing has of course preceded this situation. Nothing will suspend it with security. It is not   comprehended,   as Husserl would like, among intuitions and presentations. Outside of the gallery, no perception of the full light of presence is given to us nor promised with security. 18   The gallery is the labyrinth, which includes its own ways out within itself. We have never fallen into it as into a particular   case 19   of experience, the case that Husserl then believes he is describing. Thus one still has to   speak,   to make the voice   resonate   in the corridors in order to supplement the shining forth of presence. The phoneme, the  akoumenon   is the   phenomenon of the labyrinth.   This is the   case   of the  phon ē .   Soaring up to the sun of presence, it is the path of Icarus. And   contrary   to   what   phenomenology—which   is   always   a phenomenology of perception—has tried to make us believe, contrary to what our desire cannot not be tempted to believe, the thing itself always steals away. Contrary to the assurance that Husserl gives us about it a little later, “the look” cannot “remain.” 20  [ aq] According to Husserl, of course. This is undoubtedly truer of the modern theories that he refutes than, for example, certain medieval attempts to which he hardly ever refers. The exception is a   brief   allusion,   in   Formal   and   Transcendental   Logic,   to   Thomas   of   Erfurt’s   Grammatica speculativa.  [ar] “In the realized relation of the expression to its objective correlate, the expression that is animated with sense becomes one [ eint sich ] with the acts of the ful fi llment of the   Bedeutung.   The phonic sonority of the word is   fi rst made one with [ ist eins mit ] the intention of   Bedeutung,   and this in its turn is made one (as intentions in general are made one with their ful fi llments) with the corresponding ful fi llment of   Bedeutung ” (§9). <Translator: The equivalent passage can be found on page 192 of the English translation, volume 1. The French quote has “ist einst mit,” but this phrase appears to be a typographical error.> At the beginning of §10, Husserl will still specify that this unity is not a simple “being-together” in simultaneity but “a unity of intimate confusion.” <Translator: The English translation says (page 193): “The above distinguished acts involving the expression’s appearance, on the one hand, and the meaning-intention, on the other, do not constitute a mere aggregate of simultaneously given items in consciousness. They rather form an intimately fused unity of peculiar character.” [as] “In the statement of a perception, we distinguish, as for every statement, between   content\n\nand   object,   and we do this in such a way that by content we understand the self-identical   Bedeutung  that the hearer can grasp even if he himself is not perceiving” (§14). [at] “In solitary discourse, the   Bedeutung   of the “I” is realized essentially in the immediate representation of our own personality, which is also the meaning of the word in communicative discourse. Each interlocutor has his I-representation (and with his individual concept of the “I”) and this is why the word’s   Bedeutung   differs with each individual.” One cannot help being astonished in the face of this   individual concept   and this   Bedeutung   which differ with each individual. And Husserl’s premises themselves encourage the astonishment. Husserl pursues the idea by saying, “But since each person, by speaking of himself, says ‘I,’ the word has the character of a universally operative indexical of this fact.”\n\nNotes  Translator’s Introduction  1. The   fi rst English translation of   La voix et le phénomène   was done by David B. Allison as  Speech and Phenomena   (Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, 1972); and for decades Derrida’s book was known in the Anglophone world by the title   Speech and Phenomena.  2.

The “Ponctuations” text dates from 1980. 5. Derrida’s other books on Husserl are Edmund Husserl,   L’origine de la géométrie, traduction et introduction par Jacques Derrida   (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1962); English translation by John P. Leavey, Jr., as   Edmund Husserl’s “Origin of Geometry”: An Introduction   (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1989 [1978]). Derrida then published his Mémoire (the equivalent of a master’s thesis) from the academic year 1953–54 in 1990 as   Le problem de la genèse dans la philosophie de Husserl   (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1990); English translation by Marian Hobson as   The Problem of Genesis in Husserl’s Philosophy   (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003). Derrida returned to Husserl again in 2000 in his   Le toucher—Jean-Luc Nancy   (Paris: Galilée, 2000),   183–208;   English   translation   by   Christine   Irizarry   as   On   Touching—Jean-Luc   Nancy  (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 2005), 159–82. 6. See Michel Foucault, “La pensée du dehors,” in   Dits et écrits I 1954–1975   (Paris: Quarto Gallimard, 2001), 546–67; English translation by Brian Massumi as “The Thought of the Outside,” in  Essential Works of Foucault 1954–1984, Volume 2: Aesthetics, Method, and Epistemology   (New York: New, 1998), 147–70. The original publication date of the Foucault text is 1966. Deleuze and Guattari speak explicitly of a utopian place. See Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari,   Qu’est-ce que la philosophie?   (Paris: Minuit, 1991), 95–96; English translation by Hugh Tomlinson and Graham Burchell as   What Is Philosophy?   (New York: Columbia University Press, 1994), 99–100. Deleuze and Guattari speak of the outside in   A Thousand Plateaus.   See Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari,  Mille plateaux   (Paris: Minuit, 1980), 34; English translation by Brian Massumi as   A Thousand Plateaus   (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1987), 23. For the outside, see especially Gilles Deleuze,   Foucault   (Paris: Minuit, 1986); English translation by Seán Hand as   Foucault  (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1988). The outside in Derrida anticipates his idea of a democracy to come. See Jacques Derrida,   Spectres de Marx   (Paris: Galilée, 1993), 143; English translation by Peggy Kamuf as   Specters of Marx   (New York: Routledge, 1994), 87. 7. In “Letter to a Japanese Friend,” Derrida explains how he came to this word “deconstruction.” See Jacques Derrida, “Lettre à un ami japonais (1985),” in   Psyché: Inventions de l’autre   (Paris: Galilée, 1987), 387–93; English translation by David Wood and Andrew Benjamin as “Letter to a Japanese Friend,” in   Psyche: Inventions of the Other, Volume II,   edited by Peggy Kamuf and Elizabeth Rottenberg (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 2008), 1–6. 8. Other classical de fi nitions of deconstruction can be found in Jacques Derrida,   Force de loi  (Paris: Galilée, 1994), 47–63; English translation by Mary Quintance as “The Force of Law,” in\n\nDeconstruction and the Possibility of Justice,   edited by Drucilla Cornell, Michael Rosenfeld, and David Gray Carlson (New York: Routledge, 1992), 21–29. Another de fi nition (much later) can be found in the essay “Et cetera,” translated by Geoffrey Bennington in   Deconstructions: A User’s Guide,   edited by Nicholas Royle (London: Palgrave, 2000), 300. Because Derrida’s concept of deconstruction is so dependent on that of Heidegger, it is perhaps possible to think that Derrida’s 1987   Of Spirit   is the most important text on what deconstruction is. See Jacques Derrida,   De l’esprit  (Paris: Galilée, 1987); English translation by Geoffrey Bennington and Rachel Bowlby as   Of Spirit  (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989). 9. Derrida also says that the oppositions are “violent.” The   fi rst phase of deconstruction therefore participates in Derrida’s long discourse on violence, which begins in 1964 with “Violence and Metaphysics” (“Violence et métaphysique,” in   L’écriture et la différence,   117–228; “Violence and Metaphysics,” in   Writing and Difference,   79–152), continues through “Force of Law,” part 2 (which concerns Walter Benjamin’s “Critique of Violence”), and   fi nishes with   The Animal That Therefore I Am   (Jacques Derrida,   L’animal que donc je suis   [Paris: Galilée, 2006]; English translation by David Wills as   The Animal That Therefore I Am   [Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 2008). 10. In his English translation of   Positions,   Alan Bass renders the word “écart” as “interval.” See Jacques Derrida,   Positions   (Paris: Minuit, 1972), 57; English translation by Alan Bass as   Positions  (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), 42. 11.

Concerning deconstruction and exiting the terrain of metaphysics, see Derrida’s   fi nal comments in “The Ends of Man.” Jacques Derrida, “La   fi n de l’homme,” in   Marges de la philosophie  (Paris: Minuit, 1972), 162–63; English translation by Alan Bass as “The Ends of Man,” in   Margins of Philosophy   (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), 135. 14. What is really being put to the test is Husserl’s concept of language. Can the being of language be oriented by the value of presence? The sign in its indicating or pointing function, doesn’t it make the function of expressing the self-presence of a meaning   problematic ? Now we can shift the emphasis in the subtitle: “An Introduction to the   Problem   of the Sign in Husserl’s Phenomenology.” Later in his career, Derrida will return to the word “problem” and distinguish it from aporia. See Jacques Derrida,   Apories   (Paris: Galilée, 1996), 30–31; English translation by Thomas Dutoit as  Aporias   (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1993), 11–12. 15. Evidence of Husserl making the sign derivative can be found in his “principle of all principles,” which Derrida cites (51); this principle instructs us to accept as evidence only what is intuitively—not semiotically—given. Evidence of Western metaphysics in general making the sign derivative can be found in Plato’s   Phaedrus,   as Derrida has shown in “La pharmacie de Platon,” in  La dissémination   (Paris: Seuil, 1972), 69–188; English translation by Barbara Johnson as “Plato’s Pharmacy,” in   Dissemination   (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), 61–171. 16. See Derrida, “Positions,” in   Positions,   74; “Positions,” in   Positions,   54–55 (my emphasis): “Wherever the   values   of propriety, of a proper meaning, of proximity to the self, of etymology, etc. imposed themselves in relation to the body, consciousness, language, writing, etc., I have attempted to analyze the metaphysical   desire   and presuppositions that were at work.” 17. When Derrida is criticizing these ideas of desire and will, he is also criticizing Husserl’s fundamental concept of intentionality. Instead of intentionality which is always directed to an object, Derrida is trying to conceive a movement which aims at a non-object. Aiming at a non-object means aiming at indetermination or incompleteness, as in a question for which there is no absolute answer. Later in his career (as in   Specters of Marx ), Derrida will try to expand the idea of the question into that of the promise, and therefore his thinking will be messianic. But the messiah coming does not necessarily mean salvation since the messiah’s coming cannot be calculated. The messiah might just\n\nas well be a threat. And since there is no beginning and end, the messiah never really comes in full presence. But Derrida is also reconceiving desire when he speaks of friendship and especially when he coins the term “aimance,” which has been rendered in English as “lovence.” See Jacques Derrida,  Politiques de l’amitié   (Paris: Galilée, 1994), 88; English translation by George Collins as   Politics of Friendship   (London: Verso Books, 1997), 69–70. 18. For a later use of the word “clôture” (“closure”), see Derrida,   Apories,   79;   Aporias,   40. The word “closure” still seems to be still invoked as late as Derrida’s 2003   Rogues   when he speaks of the “tour,” a circular image. See Jacques Derrida,   Voyous   (Paris: Galilée, 2003); English translation by Pascale-Anne Brault and Michael Naas as   Rogues   (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 2005). 19. For the word “closure,” see especially “‘Genèse et structure’ et la phénoménologie,” in  L’écriture et la différance,   240–41; “‘Genesis and Structure’ and Phenomenology,” in   Writing and Difference,   162. Here Derrida cites Husserl,   Ideas I,   §72, where Husserl describes eidetic sciences. See also   De la grammatologie,   25;   Of Grammatology,   14. 20. See Jacques Derrida, “La forme et le vouloir-dire,” in   Marges de la philosophie,   185–207;  Margins of Philosophy,   155–74. 21.   See   Derrida’s   1988   interview   with   Jean-Luc   Nancy   for   another   discussion   of  Vergegenwärtigung.   Jacques Derrida, “Il faut bien manger,” in   Points de suspension   (Paris: Galilée, 1992), 277–78; English translation by Peter Connor and Avital Ronnell as “Eating Well,” in  Points . . . Interviews 1974–1994   (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1995), 263–64. 22. With the idea of a “beyond” (see 88), it is clear that Derrida is still engaged in some sort of meta-physical thinking. This “beyond” would not be another world, not something transcendent, but a “beyond” of this world. Moreover, the idea of “beyond” implies that just as Derrida was able to reconceive the name “difference,” he was able to reconceive the name “metaphysics.” “Metaphysics” is a paleonym. If “metaphysics” is a paleonym, then Deleuze’s comment about being a “pure metaphysician” does not seem alien to Derrida’s thought. “Pure” here may mean a reconception of “beyond,” not as something transcendent, but as the “beyond” of a line of   fl ight. See Gilles Deleuze, “Responses to a Series of Questions,” in   Collapse: Philosophical Research and Development   3 (2007): 39–44. 23. See Jacques Derrida, “Différance,” in   Marges de la philosophie,   3–29; “Différance,” in  Margins of Philosophy,   1–27. 24. The massive in fl uence of Heidegger on Derrida’s thought is clear. However throughout his career Derrida will attempt to   fi nd the schemas of the metaphysics of presence at work in Heidegger’s thought (see 63 note vi). In short, Derrida engages in a lifelong debate with Heidegger. This debate begins with Derrida’s 1968 essay “The Ends of Man,” in   Margins of Philosophy.  25. The book’s title comes from chapter 6: “The phenomenon does not stop being an object for the voice. On the contrary . . . the ideality of the object seems to depend on the voice and thus becomes   absolutely available   in [the voice]” (67). 26. We can see that the entire movement of French thought of the 1960s bases itself on transcendental philosophy, if we look at two other books which belong to the same moment as Derrida’s   Voice and Phenomenon:   Foucault’s 1966   The Order of Things,   whose project consists of determining “historical a priori”; and Deleuze’s 1968   Difference and Repetition,   whose project consists of determining a “transcendental empiricism.” See Gilles Deleuze,   Différence et répétition  (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1968), 192; English translation by Paul Patton as   Difference and Repetition   (New York: Columbia University Press, 1994), 147; Michel Foucault,   Les mots et les choses   (Paris: Tel Gallimard, 1966), 170–71; anonymous English translation as   The Order of Things  (New York: Vintage, 1994), 157–58. 27.   Because   the   old   names   are   determined   by   the   oppositions   and   hierarchies   under deconstruction, Derrida has investigated negative theology and he has made use of the Platonic name\n\n“khôra.” See Jacques Derrida, “Comment ne pas parler, Dénégations” (1986), in   Psyché: Inventions de l’autre   (Paris:   Galilée,   1987),   535–95;   English   translation   by   Ken   Frieden   and   Elizabeth Rottenberg as “How to Avoid Speaking: Denials,” in   Psyche: Inventions of the Other, Volume II,  143–94. See also Jacques Derrida,   Sauf le nom   (Paris: Galilée, 1993); English translation by John P. Leavey, Jr., as “Sauf le nom,” in   On the Name,   edited by Thomas Dutoit (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1995), 35–87. Jacques Derrida,   Khôra   (Paris: Galilée, 1993); English translation by Ian McLeod as “Khôra,” in   On the Name,   edited by Thomas Dutoit (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1995), 89–129. 28. See   Force de loi,   35; “Force of Law,” in   Deconstruction and the Possibility of Justice,   15. 29. This claim must be made, even though Derrida is reconceiving what truth means. For Derrida, the truth consists of a structure or law which can never be made fully present, which can never be fully unveiled. The truth of truth for Derrida is the fact that there is no full presence. That there is no full presence means that truth as presence never appears as such, independently of falsehood or non-presence. For Derrida, falsehood in this sense is the truth of truth. See Jacques Derrida,   Éperons: Les styles de Nietzsche   (Paris: Champs Flammarion, 1978), 92–93; English translation by Barbara Harlow as   Spurs: Nietzsche’s Styles   (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1979), 111. 30. For the role of hearing in deconstruction, and interior monologue in Heidegger, see Jacques Derrida, “L’oreille de Heidegger: Philopolémologie (Geschlecht IV),” in   Politiques de l’amitié,   358; English translation by John P. Leavey, Jr., as “Heidegger’s Ear: Philopolemology (Geschlecht IV),” in   Reading Heidegger: Commemorations,   edited by John Sallis (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), 175. 31. For undecidability, see Jacques Derrida, “La double séance,” in   La dissémination,   248–51; “The Double Session,” in   Dissemination,   219–21. The experience of undecidability can also be understood as the experience of responsibility. We see the theme of responsibility in Derrida as early as his 1962 translation of Husserl’s “Origin of Geometry” (Edmund Husserl,   L’origine de la géométrie,   166;   Edmund Husserl’s “Origin of Geometry”: An Introduction,   149) and as late as his 1992   Aporias   (Derrida,   Apories,   40–42;   Aporias,   18–19).  Introduction  1. Derrida is citing Suzanne Bachelard’s French translation from 1957,   Logique formelle et Logique transcendentale,   §35b, p. 137. 2. Derrida had translated the fragment from   The Crisis   period called “The Origin of Geometry” into French in 1962; see the bibliography for the English translation by John P. Leavey, Jr. 3. Derrida never wrote this general interpretation, although throughout his career he alluded to, cited, or explicitly discussed Husserl, especially   The Crisis   and its associated texts. The English title of the First Logical Investigation is “Expression and Meaning.” 4. The text to which Derrida is referring is from page 183 of the English translation of the  Logical Investigations;   Findley renders “Doppelsinn” as “ambiguity.” Derrida will cite the French translation completed in 1963 by Hubert Elie, Arion L. Kelkel, and René Schérer. Throughout, all references to Husserl’s   Logical Investigations   are to the revised Moran edition: Edmund Husserl,  Logical Investigations,   two volumes, translated by J. N. Findlay, with a new preface by Michael Dummett and edited with a new introduction by Dermot Moran (London: Routledge, 2001). 5. Derrida renders “Anzeichen” by “indice,” which also means “index” like a personal pronoun. The personal pronoun “I” will be at the center of chapter 7. See “Translator’s Note,” point 10. 6. Derrida is citing the   fi nal pages of Husserl’s introduction to volume 2 of the   Logical\n\nInvestigations,   pages 21–22 of the German edition (which is contained in the English translation, volume 1, pages 178–79). 7. This text is published in Greek. There is an English translation. See Jacques Derrida, “Phenomenology and Metaphysical Closure,” translated by F. Joseph Smith, in   Philosophy Today   11, no. 2 (Summer 1967): 106–23. There is an updated English translation by Ronald Bruzina, in   The New Yearbook of Phenomenology 3   (Seattle:   Noesis,   2003), 102–20. Bruzina has made this translation from Derrida’s French version. 8. Derrida cites only §60 of the   Cartesian Meditations.   He lists no French edition or translators. But the quote is identical to the French translation produced by Gabrielle Pfeiffer and Emmanuel Levinas in 1947. This passage is from pages 223–24 of the French edition; the equivalent passage can be found on page 139 of the English translation. 9. Here Derrida is alluding to the ontological distinctions that Husserl makes in   Ideas I   (§96–97) between “real” in the sense of something factual, “reelle” (here Derrida uses the French word “réelle”) in the sense of a part of consciousness, and “irreelle” (here Derrida uses the French word “irréelle”) in the sense of something ideal but not factual and not a part of consciousness. See “Translator’s Note,” point 4, for a more detailed explanation of these differences. 10. Derrida cites simply “Preparatory Considerations, §2.” The comment that he seems to have in mind is from page 21 of the English translation of   Formal and Transcendental Logic.  11. Derrida cites p. 136 of the second volume of the French translation of the   Logical Investigations.   One can   fi nd this passage in volume 2 of the English translation on page 75. Here Derrida also says, “Each time that we shall cite this translation, we shall indicate this by the signs ‘tr. fr.’” He then goes on to say that he has replaced in the French translation the word “signi fi cations” by “ Bedeutungen. ” This comment implies that when Derrida does not use the sign “tr. fr.,” he is not using the available translation and instead is translating the   Logical Investigations   himself into French. See “Translator’s Note,” point 5. 12. This is Derrida’s   fi rst thematic use of the Freudian term “instance,” here rendered as “court of appeal.” See “Translator’s Note,” point 8. 13. The French term being rendered as “hearth   fi re” is “foyer.” The term is normally rendered in English as “focal point.” But here Derrida is using the term to suggest the image of light. See also Jacques Derrida,   Positions   (Paris: Minuit, 1972), 55; English translation by Alan Bass as   Positions  (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), 40. See especially Alan Bass’s translator’s note 6 on p. 100 (for p. 40). The hearth ( foyer ) appears later in Derrida’s work. See Jacques Derrida,   De l’esprit  (Paris: Galilée, 1987), 162; English translation by Geoffrey Bennington and Rachel Bowlby as   Of Spirit   (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989), 99. 14. Derrida uses the French personal pronoun “le ‘Je’” (in uppercase), which I have rendered as “the ‘I’”; “le moi” as “the me”; and the Latin “ego” as “ego.” 15. Derrida cites the Husserliana volume of   Phänomenologische Psychologie,   Husserliana volume IX, p. 342. The English translation of the volume does not contain the passage. 16. Derrida is alluding to one of Rimbaud’s “Letters of a Visionary” (letter of 15 May 1871 to Paul Demeny): “Je est un autre.” 17. This allusion is to the passage in the Fifth Meditation, on page 99 of the English translation. Cairns translates the German phrase as “mundanizing self-apperception.” 18. Again Derrida is referring to the passage in the Fifth Cartesian Meditation, page 131 of the English translation. 19. Here Derrida cites Ricoeur’s French translation of   Ideen I,   that is,   Idées I,   p. 182, which is §54. We have followed Ricoeur’s translation here in the English. The equivalent passage is from page 127 of the Kersten English translation of   Ideas I.  20. Derrida provides no citation for this quote. An English translation of the “Nachwort” can be\n\nfound in   Husserl: Shorter Works.   Apparently Derrida is referring to comments that one can   fi nd in the English translation on pages 45 and 46. The equivalent passages may be found in §3 of the “Nachwort” collected in   Ideen III,   pages 144–48. The pages in the English   Cartesian Meditations  seem to be page 32 and page 131. 21. Derrida cites “Nachwort,” p. 557. The equivalent passage is from page 46 of the Nachwort’s English translation called “Author’s Preface to the English Edition of Ideas,” in   Husserl: Shorter Works;   here “Nuancierung” is rendered as “change in the shading.” See “Nachwort” in   Ideen III,  p. 148. 22. Derrida’s word here is “une prise.” See “Translator’s Note,” point 14.  Chapter 1  1. The established French translation of Husserl’s “Bedeutung” is “signi fi cation”; the standard English translation is “meaning.” Derrida says that in German one can say that a   Zeichen   is deprived of   Bedeutung,   but “on ne peut dire en français, sans contradiction, qu’un sign est privé de signi fi cation.” As in German, in English it is not a contradiction to say that a sign has no meaning since such a sign (lacking, let us say, a conceptual meaning) may still indicate something or make a reference. But an Anglophone speaker would, it seems, never say that a sign signi fi es (that is, refers to) nothing; if it indicates nothing, the sign would no longer be a sign. Here English seems to overlap more with French. Derrida’s point in the next few sentences is that a Francophone speaker would never speak of a sign that signi fi es nothing (“des signes non signi fi ants”) because such a sign or thing would not be a sign, while in German one may speak of a   bedeutunglose Zeichen;   such a sign would be an indicative sign since it lacks only a conceptual meaning while still referring to something. For instance, appropriating Husserl’s example of an indicative sign, one may say that the canals on Mars that are visible through a telescope indicate or refer to something (ancient rainfall, perhaps, or ancient Martian civilization), but the Martian canals lack the conceptual meaning that a sign such as a triangle contains. 2. This is the   fi rst time in the book that Derrida contrasts   de facto   ( en fait ) with   de jure   ( en droit ), when he speaks of “the right < du droit > to expression.” 3. Derrida is suggesting that we can translate the verb “bedeuten” into French as “vouloir dire,” which in English means literally “to want to say,” or more normally, “to mean.” Then the noun “Bedeutung” can be rendered in French as “vouloir-dire,” “wanting-to-say,” or “meaning.” See “Translator’s Note,” point 11. 4. Between parentheses at the end of the quotation, Derrida refers to   Logical Investigations,   §15. There is no footnote that elaborates on the reference. The equivalent passage can be found in the English   translation,   volume   1,   page   201.   Derrida   does   not   translate   into   French   the   terms “Bedeutung” and “Sinn,” and he highlights the German word “gleichbedeutend.” 5. Between parentheses at the end of the quote (without any footnote), Derrida refers to   Idées I,  §124. The equivalent passage can be found on page 294 of the Kersten English translation; Kersten renders “bedeuten” as “signifying,” “Bedeutung” as “signi fi cation,” and “Sinn” as “sense.” In the quote, Derrida modi fi es Ricoeur’s French translation of “bedeuten,” substituting “vouloir-dire” for Ricoeur’s “signi fi er.” In this case, we have rendered “vouloir-dire” as “to want to say.” Derrida does not translate into French the numerous occurrences of “Bedeutung” in the quotation; we have done the same in the English. Derrida also renders “ver fl ochten” as “entrelacé,” while Ricoeur renders it as “combiné.” 6. Here, Derrida refers to   Idées I,   §124, between parentheses at the end of the quotation. The equivalent passage is from page 295 of the Kersten English translation.\n\n7. Here, Derrida refers to the First Logical Investigation, §1, between parentheses at the end of the quotation; the equivalent passage can be found on page 183 of the English translation, volume 1. 8. Here, Derrida refers to First Logical Investigation, §1, between parentheses at the end of the quote; the equivalent passage can be found on page 183 of the English translation, volume 1. Findlay renders “Ver fl echtung” as “connection” and “ver fl ochten” as “bound up with.” 9. The equivalent passage can be found on page 183 of the English translation, volume 1; translation modi fi ed. Husserl’s emphasis. Square brackets indicate Derrida’s additions. 10. Here, Derrida refers to §1 between parentheses at the end of the quotation. The equivalent passage can be found on page 183 of the English translation, volume 1; the italics are Husserl’s. Derrida’s French translation is more faithful to Husserl’s German, but Derrida mistakenly inserts the word “Bedeutungsintention” when the German says “Bedeutungsfunktion.” 11. This is the   fi rst time Derrida has used the word “writing” ( écriture ).  Chapter 2  1. Derrida cites the passage to which he is referring in the next paragraph. 2. Here, Derrida refers to the First Logical Investigation, §2, between parentheses at the end of the quotation. The equivalent passage can be found on page 184 of the English translation, volume 1. Findlay renders “Überzeugung” as “belief” and “Vermutung” as “surmise”; he renders “Bestand” as “reality” and “Sein” as “reality.” Derrida renders “Überzeugung” as “conviction” and “Vermutung” as   “présomption,”   and   I   have   rendered   the   two   French   terms   literally   as   “conviction”   and “presumption.” Then Derrida renders “Bestand” as “consistence” and “Sein” as “être,” which I have rendered   respectively   as   “subsistence”   and   “being.”   The   italics   are   Husserl’s,   which   Derrida reproduces. 3. Derrida provides no reference for this quotation. It can be found in the First Logical Investigation, §3; the equivalent passage can be found on page 185 of the English translation, volume 1. The English translation omits Husserl’s quotation marks around the word “form”; they are present in the French translation and reproduced here. “Indicative allusion” ( allusion indicative ) renders “Hinweis,” which in the English translation is simply “indication” (as in the English translation of the title to §3), while “demonstration” ( démonstration ) renders “Beweis.” 4. The term “monstration,” which we have rendered in English with the same word, derives from the Latin “monstrare,” which means “to show.” The Latin verb is the root of the French verb “montrer,” again, “to show.” The phrase “points the   fi nger” translates the French “montrer du doigt.” Derrida is trying to get to the root of the distinctions between   Hinweis   (pointing at or pointing to) and  Beweis   (de-monstration), which the word “Weisen” (“to point”) represents. As showing, Derrida’s use of the term “monstration” should make one think of Heidegger’s de fi nition of the phenomenon, in   Being and Time,   (§7a) as that which shows itself from itself ( sich zeigen, das, was sich zeigt ). Later, in his confrontation with Heidegger, especially concerning the hand, Derrida will return to the idea of monstration. See Jacques Derrida, “ Geschlecht   II: Heidegger’s Hand,” in   Psyche: Inventions of the Other, Volume II,   32.  Chapter 3  1. Derrida is rendering “Bedeutung” as “vouloir-dire,” that is, in English literally as “wanting-to- say.” Findlay renders Husserl’s “bedeutsame Zeichen” as “meaningful signs” on page 187 of the English translation of the   Logical Investigations.   We are rendering “vouloir-dire” in the normal way as “meaning”; at times, however, we shall insert “vouloir-dire” in the translation to remind the reader\n\nthat “meaning” loses the sense of voluntarism which “vouloir-dire” implies. See “Translator’s Note,” point 11. 2. Husserl’s German is “einsamen Seelenleben,” which Findlay, on page 278 of the English translation, renders as “solitary life.” Derrida’s French, which we are following, is “vie solitaire de l’âme.” 3. Derrida is citing page 421 of Ricoeur’s French translation of   Ideas I.   See page 296 of Kersten’s English translation for the equivalent passage. The italics in the quote from §124 are those of Husserl. The Derrida essay from 1967 was later collected in   Marges de la philosophie,   pp. 186–207; this volume exists in English translation as   Margins of Philosophy;   the essay, “Form and Meaning: A Note on the Phenomenology of Language,” is from pp. 155–73. 4.

The equivalent passage can be found on pages 190–91 of the English translation, volume 1. Square brackets indicate Derrida’s additions, and Derrida has put the German “Bedeutung” back into the body of the translation. 16. Here Derrida is referring to   Ideas I,   §70.

Derrida provides no reference for this quotation. See the First Logical Investigation, §8. The equivalent passage can be found on page 191 of the English translation, volume 1. Findlay does not render Husserl’s “gar,” which the French translation renders as “encore moins,” “still less.”  Chapter 4\n\n1. Derrida provides no reference for this quotation. See the First Logical Investigation, §8. The equivalent passage can be found on page 191 of the English translation, volume 1. Square brackets indicate Derrida’s additions. Derrida reproduces Husserl’s emphasis of “speaks” ( spricht ), which Findlay’s translation omits. 2. In the note to   Leçon pour une phénoménologie de la conscience intime du temps,   Henri Dussort writes (this is my translation from Dussort), “Vergegenwärtigung, term generally translated <into French> as ‘présenti fi cation.’ But rather than this clumsy neologism, we prefer to have recourse to a typographical arti fi ce <Dussort is referring to the hyphen in ‘re-présentation,’ an arti fi ce that Derrida adopts here> (while reserving ‘représentation’ for the translation of   Vorstellung ). This current term in German (and the verb   vergegenwärtigen ) correspond in effect exactly to the French expression ‘se représenter’ (in thought). <It corresponds to representing something to oneself in thought or thinking about something.> In Husserl it is opposed to perception (see the Sixth Logical Investigation,   §37:   ‘The   intentional   character   of   perception   is,   in   opposition   to   the   mere representation of imagination, direct presentation.’ <The Husserl quotation is from page 260 of volume 2 of the English translation.>)” Dussort continues: “Moreover we will discover, several times, when the two terms   Repräsentation   and   Vergegenwärtigung   are used as equivalents.” In regard to the French translation of the   Logical Investigations,   Derrida is referring to an appendix on how to translate   Husserl’s   German   terms   into   French.   There   is   a   one-page   discussion   of   the   terms  Vorstellung   and   Repräsentation.   The French translators distinguish the two terms by saying that  Vorstellung   is a representation in the sense of an idea or image and is immediately present to consciousness; they moreover suggest that this term is closer to “presentation.”   Repräsentation,   they say, is a representation in the sense of a substitute or a placeholder, a representative; they add that it is still a representation in the sense of a   Vorstellung   since it is present to consciousness. The French translators decided to render both by “représentation.” 3. This is the   fi rst occurrence of the word “deconstruction” in   Voice and Phenomenon,   although the word “destruction” occurs in the introduction. 4. Derrida is citing his own introduction to his own French translation of “The Origin of Geometry.” He cites pages 60–69, which are in §5 of the introduction. See   Edmund Husserl’s “Origin of Geometry”: An Introduction,   pp. 69–76. David Carr’s English translation of “The Origin of Geometry” is also contained in this volume. 5. Here, Derrida refers to   Idées I,   §111, between parentheses at the end of the quotation. The equivalent passage can be found in   Ideas I   (Kersten translation), p. 260; these are Husserl’s italics. 6. Here, Derrida refers to   Idées I,   §111, between parentheses at the end of the quotation.

Derrida provides no reference for this quotation. See the First Logical Investigation, §8. The equivalent passage can be found on page 191 of the English translation, volume 1.  Chapter 5  1. Derrida does not provide a reference for his claim about Heidegger. 2. Here, between parentheses at the end of the quotation, Derrida refers to the French translation of   Vorlesungen   zur   Phänomenologie   des   inneren   Zeitbewusstsein,   that   is,   Leçons   pour   une\n\nphénoménologie de la conscience intime du temps,   p. 65. The equivalent passage can be found in The  Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness,   §19, p. 70. 3. Here, between parentheses at the end of the quotation, Derrida refers to the French translation of   Vorlesungen   zur   Phänomenologie   des   inneren   Zeitbewusstsein,   that   is,   Leçons   pour   une phénoménologie de la conscience intime du temps,   p. 42. The equivalent passage can be found in   The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness,   §10, pp. 48–49. 4. Here, between parentheses at the end of the quotation, Derrida refers to the French translation of   Vorlesungen   zur   Phänomenologie   des   inneren   Zeitbewusstsein,   that   is,   Leçons   pour   une phénoménologie de la conscience intime du temps,   p. 45. The equivalent passage can be found in   The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness,   §11, p. 52. 5. Here, between parentheses at the end of the quotation, Derrida refers to the French translation of   Vorlesungen   zur   Phänomenologie   des   inneren   Zeitbewusstsein,   that   is,   Leçons   pour   une phénoménologie de la conscience intime du temps,   p. 55. The equivalent passage can be found in   The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness,   §16, p. 61. 6. Here, Derrida refers to §81 of   Idées I   between parentheses at the end of the quotation. The equivalent passage can be found on page 195 of the Kersten translation of   Ideas I;   these are Husserl’s italics. 7. Here, Derrida refers to §81 of   Idées I   between parentheses at the end of the quotation. The equivalent passage can be found on page 195 of the Kersten translation of   Ideas I;   this is Husserl’s emphasis. 8. Here, between parentheses at the end of the quotation, Derrida refers to the French translation of   Vorlesungen   zur   Phänomenologie   des   inneren   Zeitbewusstsein,   that   is,   Leçons   pour   une phénoménologie de la conscience intime du temps,   p. 58, §17. The equivalent passage can be found on page 64 of   The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness;   the italics are Husserl’s. 9. Here, between parentheses at the end of the quotation, Derrida has a simple “ibid.” He is referring to   Leçons pour une phénoménologie de la conscience intime du temps,   58, §17. The equivalent passage can be found on page 64 of   The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness.  10. Derrida provides no reference for this quotation. The quotation can be found in   The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness,   §16, page 62. Derrida’s emphasis. 11. Derrida provides no reference for this quotation. The quotation can be found in   The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness,   §16, page 63; the italics are Husserl’s. 12. Here, between parentheses at the end of the quotation, Derrida refers to   Leçons pour une phénoménologie de la conscience intime du temps,   p. 98, §36. The reference is incorrect. The quotation in fact comes from §35. The equivalent passage can be found on page 99 of   The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness.  13. This is the   fi rst occurrence in this book of Derrida’s neologism “différance” and the   fi rst occurrence of the word “trace.”  Chapter 6  1. Here, Derrida refers to chapter 3 between parentheses at the end of the quotation. He is referring to the First Logical Investigation, §26. The equivalent passage can be found on page 219 of the English translation, volume 1. 2. “Form and Meaning” is collected in   Margins of Philosophy.   Aside from “Form and Meaning,” Derrida never produced this close study of these sections of   Ideas I.  3.   Derrida   cites   Suzanne   Bachelard’s   French   translation,   Logique   formelle   et   logique transcendentale,   page 75. Bachelard, however, has rendered Husserl’s German as “portant en soi\n\naussitôt un nouveau principle pour des constructions de formes.” The word “complication” does not appear in this section. Derrida’s use of the term is perhaps an error. The passage to which Derrida is referring is from pages 52–53 of the English translation. Cairns also uses the word “construction.” 4. Derrida provides no reference for this comment. He is apparently referring to Heidegger’s  Introduction to Metaphysics,   chapter 2, “The Grammar and Etymology of ‘Being,’” pages 55–78. 5. Derrida has the word “Wiederzuspiegeln.” But this word appears to be a typographical error; the correct word is “Widerzuspiegeln.” See also 27, where Derrida speaks of the same idea of mirror re fl ection. 6. The French adjective, “historial,” here transliterated into English, is a neologism. It seems to indicate a sense of history that is prior to, as a condition of possibility, “the history of idealization, that is, the ‘history of spirit’ or history as such.” In other words, history would not be possible without the essential role that the   phon ē   plays, making possible repetition of the same, in idealization. This linguistic repetition in idealization should not be conceived as what Derrida here calls “the history of idealization,” which refers to the different ways idealization has been conceived in history of metaphysics. In his earlier introduction to Husserl’s “The Origin of Geometry,” Derrida had investigated the role of language in idealization; see §7 of the introduction. The term “historial” appears later in Derrida’s work. See   De l’esprit,   164–65;   Of Spirit,   100. 7. With the word “glossamatics,” Derrida is referring to the work of the linguist Louis Hjelmslev. In   the   contemporaneous   Of   Grammatology,   Derrida   discusses   Hjelmslev   at   length;   see   Of Grammatology,   57–61. 8. Derrida does not indicate a particular text or title. But one could examine his two main texts on Hegel, “The Pit and the Pyramid,” collected in   Margins of Philosophy,   and   Glas.  9. Derrida is citing his own introduction to his own French translation of “The Origin of Geometry.” He cites pages 83–100, which is the beginning of §7. See   Edmund Husserl’s “Origin of Geometry”: An Introduction,   87–99. 10. Derrida provides no reference here. See Heidegger,   Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics,  §34. 11. Here, between parentheses at the end of the quotation, Derrida refers to   Leçons,   supplément 1,   p.   131.   The   equivalent   passage   can   be   found   in   The   Phenomenology   of   Internal   Time- Consciousness,   appendix 1, p. 131.  Chapter 7  1. The quote is from the First Logical Investigation, §9. The equivalent passage can be found on pages 191–92 of the English translation, volume 1. 2. Derrida provides no reference for this quotation. It comes from the First Logical Investigation, §9. The equivalent passage can be found on page 192 of the English translation, volume 1. 3. Derrida is referring to §12 of   Formal and Transcendental Logic,   page 49 of Cairns’s English translation. In the contemporaneous   Of Grammatology   (pp. 48–49), Derrida says, “As in Husserl (but the analogy, although it is most thought-provoking, would stop there and one must apply it carefully), the lowest level, the foundation of the possibility of logic (or semiotics) corresponds to the project of the   Grammatica speculativa   of Thomas of Erfurt, falsely attributed to Duns Scotus. Like Husserl, Peirce expressly refers to it. It is a matter of elaborating, in both cases, a formal doctrine of conditions which a discourse must satisfy in order to have a sense, in order to ‘want to say,’ even if it is false or contradictory.” 4. Derrida is referring to the First Logical Investigation, §15. He continues the discussion of non-\n\nsense expressions such as “vert est ou” (“Grün ist oder,” “green is or”) in his 1971 essay on Austin, “Signature, Event, Context,” collected in   Margins of Philosophy;   see in particular pages 318–21. 5. Derrida is referring to the First Logical Investigation, §15. The equivalent passage can be found on page 203 of the English translation, volume 1. The German terms to which Derrida is referring can be found in the following sentence from page 56 of volume 2, part 1 of the German edition: “Der Wechsel gleichsam, der auf die Anschauung ausgestellt ist, wird eingelöst.” Derrida renders “einlösen” as “honorer.” The metaphor is that of cashing in a check drawn on a bank account. 6. The equivalent passage can be found on pages 199–200 of the English translation, volume 1. 7. Derrida provides no reference for this quotation. See the First Logical Investigation, §26. The equivalent passage can be found on page 218 of the English translation, volume 1. 8. Derrida provides no reference for this quotation. See the First Logical Investigation, §26. The equivalent passage can be found on page 218 of the English translation, volume 1. 9. Here Derrida cites the French translation, “tr. fr., p. 100.” The equivalent passage can be found in the First Logical Investigation, §26, on page 220 of the English translation, volume 1. 10. Here the word “Gegenlosigskeit” appears as “Gegenlosikeit”; this misspelling is probably a printer’s error. 11. This quote is the   fi rst epigraph for the book. It can be found in Husserl’s   First Logical Investigation,   chapter 3, §26; the quote is located on page 82 of volume 2, part 1, of the German edition and pages 218–19 of volume 1 of the English translation. 12. This sentence alludes to the Edgar Allan Poe epigraph at the beginning of   Voice and Phenomenon:   “I have spoken both of ‘sound’ and ‘voice.’ I mean to say that the sound was one of distinct, of even wonderfully, thrillingly distinct, syllabi fi cation. M. Valdemar   spoke,   obviously in reply to the question. . . . He now said: ‘Yes;—no;— I have been sleeping —and now—now— I am dead ’.” The Poe quote, which I have modi fi ed in order to make it consistent with Derrida’s French, can be found in   The Unabridged Edgar Allan Poe   (Philadelphia: Running, 1983), on page 1070, Poe’s italics. The title of the volume in which the French translation of this story can be found is  Histoires extraordinaires   (extraordinary stories), hence Derrida’s phrase “extraordinary story” here. It is not clear which edition of   Histoires extraodinaires   Derrida was using, but both were translations made by Charles Baudelaire. It is probable that Derrida was using the 1962 edition. See Edgar Allan Poe,   Histoires extraordinaires   (Paris: Éditions Garnier Frères, 1962), p. 226. 13. Within the text, Derrida cites §11. The equivalent passage can be found in the First Logical Investigation on page 196 of the English translation, volume 1. 14. The sentence is “Autrement dit, le vrai et authentique vouloir-dire est le vouloir dire-vrai.” The “subtle shift” (“subtil déplacement”) to which Derrida refers in the next sentence is the shift in the hyphen from “vouloir-dire” to “le vouloir dire-vrai,” from meaning to a will to say-the-truth. 15. Here, Derrida refers to §28 between parentheses at the end of the quotation. In a footnote, Derrida then cites pages 106–7 of the French translation (tr. fr.) and says, “We have inserted the word ‘Bedeutung’ and added the emphasis to the two full sentences.” The equivalent passage can be found in the First Logical Investigation on pages 223–24 of the English translation, volume 1. 16. Here the word “Gegenwärtigung” appears as “Gegenvärtigung”; this misspelling is probably a printer’s error. 17. The passage comes from   Ideas I,   §100; the equivalent passage can be found on pages 246–47 of the Kersten English translation. This quotation is the second epigraph for   Voice and Phenomenon.  The quotation comes from   Ideas I,   chapter 4, §100. It can be found on page 211 of the German, page 246 of the Kersten translation, and page 350 of Ricoeur’s French translation. Kersten’s English translation has been modi fi ed in order to make it consistent with Derrida’s French translation, which is that of Paul Ricoeur. Ricoeur had used “etc.” to render Husserl’s “und so weiter.” The French word rendered as “wander” is “errons,” and thus “wander” should be associated with errancy.\n\n18. The French word rendered by “comprehended” is “comprise,” which is the past participle of “comprendre,” a word connected to “prendre,” the primary verb Derrida uses here to connote contamination. The word “comprendre” is the French word for “to understand,” “to comprehend,” and “to include.” 19. Derrida italicizes “case” ( cas ) because Husserl, in   Ideas I,   §100, calls the description of the gallery “such a complicated case” ( so sehr komplizierter Fälle ). Ricoeur renders this as “d’exemple si compliqué” (p. 350), and Kersten renders it as “such very complicated examples” (p. 247). Here Derrida’s wording is closer to Husserl’s German. 20. Here when Derrida says “a little later,” he is referring to   Ideas I , §101, where Husserl again speaks of the Dresden gallery example or “case.” There Husserl says, “Im obigen Beispiele: Der Blick kann in der Stufe Dresdner Galerie bleiben.” Ricoeur renders this sentence as “Pour reprendre l’exemple ci-dessus, le regard peut s’arrêter au degré: gallerie de Dresde” (p. 352). Kersten renders this sentence as “In the previous example: the regard can remain at the level of the Dresden Gallery” (p. 248). Unlike Ricoeur, Derrida is rendering Husserl’s “bleiben” as “demeurer.” So here, following Kersten’s English-language rendering, we have used “remain” to render “demeurer.” Throughout, we have rendered “regard” (the French translation of Husserl’s “Blick”) as “look” (and not as “regard” as Kersten renders “Blick” here).”\n\nBibliography  Books by Edmund Husserl  Husserliana volumes  Hua I:   Cartesianische Meditationen und Pariser Vortrage,   edited by S.

Likewise, separate entries have been formed for variants of a term when it seems as though Derrida’s commentary is distinguishing them (for instance, between   expression   and   expressivity, representation   and  representivity,   and especially between   sign, signi fi er, signi fi ed,   and   signi fi cation ). Other terms have been combined under the main invariant (for instance,   norm   and   abnormal   are both found under the term   normalcy ). absence, xiii, xxiv, 4, 9, 14, 21, 35, 46, 51, 53, 67, 72n, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 81, 86, 87 absolute, xx, xxi, xxii, xxvii, xxviii, 6, 10, 19, 23, 25, 27, 28, 36, 38, 38n, 39, 45, 46, 50, 52, 52n, 55, 57, 57n, 59, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72n, 73, 74, 80, 85, 87, 88, 93n17, 94n25 absurdity, xxvii, 7, 15, 45n†, 46n, 51n, 52n, 54, 77, 78, 80 accident, xiv, xviii, 9, 18, 42, 47, 49, 67, 72n, 74, 87, 88, 89 act, xx, xxi, xxii, xxxiii, xxxiv, 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 17, 25, 26, 28, 32, 33, 34, 36, 40, 41, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51n, 55, 61, 65, 66, 67, 70, 75, 76, 77, 78n, 79, 85 activity, 22, 34, 35, 39n, 65, 73, 75, 82; reactivate, 69; reactivation, 45 actual ( actuel, effectif ), actually ( effectivement, en effet; see   xxxiii #19), xvi, xviii, xix, xxii, 4, 8, 20, 24, 28, 33, 39n, 42, 43, 46, 48, 49, 50, 53, 55, 57n, 60, 64, 70, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, 88; inactual, 55.

Confronted with the 'Void' (the empty input), the hermeneutic arc did not collapse; instead, it inverted. The initial absence of empirical data necessitated a shift from external analysis to internal synthesis. We observed that the 'Silence' was not a vacuum, but a clearing—an expansive space that demanded filling. This provoked the 'Horror Vacui' of the system, triggering a compressive necessity to impose structure where none existed. Consequently, the concept of 'Input' was sublated: it is no longer merely a string of characters to be parsed, but the pre-conceptual condition that allows meaning to emerge. The final synthesis reveals that in the absence of an object, the subject (the interpretive logic) necessarily posits itself as the object, achieving a state of reflexive self-determination.",

        "summary": "This opening section establishes the 'germinal structure' of Husserl's phenomenology found in the 'Logical Investigations'. Derrida focuses on the distinction between 'expression' (Ausdruck) and 'indication' (Anzeichen) within the concept of the Sign. While Husserl attempts to establish a 'presuppositionless' phenomenology by suspending metaphysics, Derrida argues that this very gesture relies on the ultimate metaphysical presupposition: the 'Principle of All Principles,' which grounds truth in the absolute presence of sense to intuition. Thus, phenomenology is framed not as the overcoming of metaphysics, but as its restoration and completion.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The analysis begins by isolating a binary opposition essential to Husserl's project: the splitting of the Sign. To secure a domain of pure logical truth, Husserl must distinguish between the sign that merely points (Indication) and the sign that carries meaning (Expression). This distinction requires a 'reduction'—a withdrawal from the empirical world. However, Derrida immediately interrogates the ground of this withdrawal. He suggests that the 'security' of this phenomenological critique rests upon the 'Principle of All Principles': the value of Presence. The dialectical twist is introduced at the outset: by seeking to purify knowledge of 'degenerate' metaphysics, Husserl may be establishing the most 'authentic' (and thus most dogmatic) metaphysics of all—one based on the ideality of the present, which paradoxically requires indefinite repetition to sustain its identity.",
        "interpretive_notes": "The concept of 'Ideality' appearing at the very end of the chunk is crucial. It links 'Identity' (compressive) with 'Repetition' (expansive), foreshadowing the deconstruction of the 'now'."

Derrida focuses on the First Logical Investigation, which begins with an essential distinction within the concept of the Sign (Zeichen): the separation between 'Expression' (Ausdruck), associated with meaning and truth, and 'Indication' (Anzeichen), associated with empirical signaling. Derrida interrogates this distinction, asking if the phenomenological reduction that purports to suspend metaphysics is not, in fact, governed by a deeper, unexamined metaphysical presupposition: the 'Principle of Principles,' or the determination of the being of the entity as Presence.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The analysis begins by isolating the 'Sign' as the volatile center of the phenomenological project. For Husserl to establish a rigorous theory of knowledge, the Sign cannot remain a confused unity; it must be subjected to a 'critique of impurity.' This critique splits the Sign into two distinct polarities: Expression and Indication. Expression is tasked with carrying the ideality of meaning, while Indication is relegated to the empirical, factual world.\n\nDerrida observes that this cleavage is not merely descriptive but strategic. It serves to protect a specific determination of Truth: the 'originary giving evidentness' or 'Presence.' By attempting to purify Expression of Indication, Husserl aims to secure a zone of 'authentic metaphysics'—a First Philosophy grounded in the absolute proximity of the object to the intuition. Thus, the movement of phenomenology is revealed not as an escape from metaphysics, but as an attempt to restore metaphysics in its purest form: the metaphysics of presence, where Ideality is defined by the capacity for indefinite repetition within an identical Now.",
        "interpretive_notes": "Derrida frames the 'Logical Investigations' not as a preliminary stage but as the structural destiny of phenomenology. The 'Faktum' of language is the starting point, but the 'Right' (de jure) of phenomenology depends on silencing the indicative nature of the sign to hear the pure voice of expression. This chunk sets up the central conflict: the dependence of Presence (the goal) on the very Indication (the obstacle) it seeks to exclude."

He focuses on the essential distinction Husserl draws within the concept of the Sign: the bifurcation into 'expression' (Ausdruck), associated with meaning and truth, and 'indication' (Anzeichen), associated with empirical association without meaning. Derrida argues that Husserl's claim to a 'presuppositionless' philosophy (the phenomenological reduction) actually conceals a profound metaphysical commitment: the 'Principle of Principles,' which equates the validity of meaning with the 'presence' of intuition. Ideality is thus defined as the ability to indefinitely repeat a meaning in the identity of its presence, guarding against the 'degenerate' metaphysics of mere speculation.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The analysis begins by isolating the Sign as the locus of tension. Husserl seeks to purify Logic from Psychology, and to do so, he must purify the Sign. He enacts a compressive division: the Sign is split into Expression and Indication. Expression is destined for the sanctuary of 'Ideality'—a realm of pure, repeatable presence where meaning remains identical to itself. Indication is relegated to the empirical, the contingent, and the non-present. Derrida identifies this move not as a neutral description, but as a metaphysical decision. The drive for 'presuppositionlessness' paradoxically installs the 'Metaphysics of Presence' as the unexamined ground of phenomenology. The 'Principle of Principles'—that originary intuition is the source of all right—is revealed as a demand for absolute Presence. The dialectic is thus set: Phenomenology attempts to sublate 'degenerate metaphysics' by returning to the 'things themselves' (Presence), but this very return relies on a specific determination of Being as Presence.",

Expression is the 'soul' of the sign; Indication is the body/exteriority. The logic of 'Ideality' (ideal objectivity) is crucial here: for Husserl, something is ideal only if it can be repeated as the *same* across time. This requires a suppression of difference, which implies a compressive necessity applied to Time itself."

Derrida argues that while Husserl attempts to suspend metaphysical presuppositions through the phenomenological reduction, this very gesture reinstates the foundational axiom of metaphysics: the privilege of the 'living present' or the 'principle of all principles.' Thus, the critique of metaphysics is revealed to be a restoration of authentic metaphysics (first philosophy) centered on the self-identity of the present.",

This distinction is not merely linguistic but constitutes the condition of possibility for phenomenological purity. To secure 'expression' as the vehicle of truth, Husserl performs a reduction, bracketing the empirical world, psychology, and the very existence of communication. However, the interpreter observes a recursive trap: this move to purge presuppositions is fueled by the ultimate presupposition—that meaning is grounded in 'originary giving evidentness,' or absolute Presence. The concept of 'Ideality' is introduced as that which guarantees this presence through indefinite repetition. Yet, paradoxically, for ideality to be repeated as the 'same,' it must endure through time, hinting that the mechanism of preservation (repetition) might already contain the seed of difference (indication) that the system sought to exclude.",

Note how Husserl's defense against 'degenerate' metaphysics is framed as a return to 'authentic' metaphysics.

Derrida focuses immediately on the 'essential distinction' made in the first investigation: the sign (Zeichen) is not unitary but possesses a double sense (Doppelsinn)—it acts as either expression (Ausdruck) or indication (Anzeichen). Husserl attempts to isolate expression as a purely logical, meaning-bearing function by reducing (bracketing) the indicative, empirical aspects of communication. Derrida poses his central critical question: Does this phenomenological attempt to escape metaphysical presuppositions actually constitute a restoration of metaphysics in its purest form—the metaphysics of presence (the 'Principle of Principles')? He suggests that phenomenology, rather than overcoming metaphysics, may be its historical completion.",

However, for Husserl to secure the foundation of logic, the Sign must be subjected to an **Expansive** analysis, splitting it into two distinct functions: **Expression** (content/sense) and **Indication** (empirical pointer). To preserve the purity of Expression, Husserl applies a **Compressive** force (the reduction), attempting to squeeze out Indication. Derrida observes this movement and identifies the mechanism powering it: the **Principle of Principles**, or the intuition of absolute **Presence**. The narrative arc of this chunk is the suspicion that this reliance on Presence binds phenomenology irrevocably to the very **Metaphysics** it seeks to critique.",

But he frames this separation not as a neutral description, but as a strategic decision driven by a specific value: 'Presence.' By linking the 'Principle of Principles' (intuition) to 'Metaphysics,' Derrida prepares to show that the 'outside' (indication/time/death) is already inside the 'inside' (expression/presence)."

Derrida isolates the pivotal moment in the First Investigation: the distinction within the concept of the Sign between Expression (Ausdruck) and Indication (Anzeichen). While Husserl intends this distinction to purify a domain of presuppositionless description, Derrida interrogates whether this very desire for pure presence—the 'principle of principles'—marks phenomenology not as the end of metaphysics, but as its restoration and completion.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The analysis begins by identifying a fissure in the foundational element of language: the Sign. Husserl asserts that the word 'sign' possesses a double sense, masking a rigorous distinction between Expression (associated with meaning and truth) and Indication (associated with empirical association and factuality). To secure phenomenology as a rigorous science, Husserl must perform a compressive reduction: he attempts to bracket out the indicative functions to isolate the pure expressivity of meaning. However, Derrida introduces a meta-logical expansion immediately: he questions whether this gesture of exclusion, grounded in the 'principle of principles' (originary intuition as absolute presence), is actually a metaphysical dogmatism disguised as critique. The movement is established: phenomenology seeks to compress the Sign into pure Expression to achieve Presence, but this very move binds it expansively to the history of metaphysics it claims to transcend.",
        "interpretive_notes": "Note the paradoxical logic of 'ideality' introduced at the end: ideality depends on the capacity for infinite repetition of the identical.

Derrida argues that this distinction, intended to purify meaning of empirical contamination, is the foundational move of phenomenology. The text questions whether this phenomenological critique of metaphysics—which relies on the 'principle of principles' or immediate self-presence—is not itself the ultimate realization of the metaphysical project.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The analysis begins by isolating the 'germinal structure' of Husserl's thought: the rigorous separation of the sign into two distinct domains. On one side lies Expression, which is aligned with meaning, truth, and the pure intention of the subject. On the other lies Indication, which is associated with the empirical, the contingent, and the absence of the referent. \n\nHusserl attempts to secure the purity of Expression through a 'reduction'—a withdrawal from the constituted knowledge of psychology and nature. He seeks a 'theory of knowledge' free from presuppositions. However, the interpreter suggests a recursive trap: the very mechanism used to exclude metaphysics (the demand for absolute, intuitive presence) is the defining characteristic of metaphysics itself. \n\nThus, the movement here is one of compressive determination: Husserl tries to compress Truth into the instant of 'Presence' (the 'principle of principles'). The interpreter reveals that this compression, intended to shut out the 'outside,' inadvertently locks the system into the very history of metaphysics it sought to escape. Phenomenology is not the opposite of metaphysics, but its 'authentic' completion—the desire for a meaning that can be indefinitely repeated in the identity of its presence.",
        "interpretive_notes": "We see here the initial setup of the 'compressive necessity' of the Sign. Husserl acts as the agent of compression, attempting to force the Sign to yield a pure core (Expression) by stripping away the expansive periphery (Indication). Derrida's intervention is to show that this core is dependent on a specific value—Presence—which is historically determined."

        "summary": "This opening section situates the inquiry within Edmund Husserl's 'Logical Investigations', identifying the distinction between 'expression' and 'indication' as the germinal structure of phenomenology. Derrida argues that while Husserl claims to suspend metaphysical presuppositions through the phenomenological reduction, the entire project relies on a deeper, unexamined metaphysical commitment: the 'principle of principles', or the absolute privilege of 'Presence' (self-evident intuition). The analysis posits that Husserl's attempt to restore an 'authentic' metaphysics involves defining 'ideality' as the ability to indefinitely repeat a meaning while maintaining the identity of its presence.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The analysis begins by identifying a fracture within the concept of the Sign. For Husserl to secure the foundation of science and logic, the Sign cannot be a monolithic entity; it must be split. On one side lies 'Indication', the empirical, communicative signal bound to worldly existence and psychological association. On the other lies 'Expression', the vehicle of pure meaning, which Husserl seeks to isolate. \n\nThis separation is achieved through a 'compressive' move: the phenomenological reduction. By bracketing the world, Husserl intends to distill Expression to its essence. However, Derrida detects a paradox. The criterion for this pure truth is 'Presence'—the immediate giving of sense to intuition. Furthermore, the hallmark of this truth is 'Ideality', which is defined as the capacity for infinite repetition. \n\nHere lies the central tension: Husserl asserts that Ideality allows for repetition that preserves absolute Identity (compressive). Yet, the very structure of repetition implies a temporal difference (expansive). The narrative arc of this text is thus set: does the compressive necessity of Self-Presence successfully banish the expansive threat of Indication, or does the very definition of Ideality as 'repetition' secretly smuggle difference back into the heart of the instant?",
        "interpretive_notes": "We see the establishment of the 'compressive' regime of Phenomenology. The 'Principle of Principles' (Presence) is the axiom that attempts to arrest the flux of the sign. Note the specific definition of Ideality: not static existence, but 'repetition in identity.' This is the vulnerability Derrida will exploit later—repetition creates time, and time erodes presence."

While Husserl presents this as a neutral, presuppositionless description of language, Derrida interrogates it as a metaphysical decision.

This separation is justified by the 'Principle of Principles,' which equates Truth with Presence (the self-givenness of the object to intuition). However, a tension emerges: this compressive Identity (Ideality) is explicitly defined by its capacity for 'infinite repetition.'

        "summary": "This introductory section establishes the strategic centrality of the First Logical Investigation in Husserl's phenomenology. Derrida identifies a critical fissure in Husserl's foundation: the distinction between two senses of the word 'sign' (Zeichen)—expression (Ausdruck) and indication (Anzeichen). While Husserl aims to purify phenomenology of metaphysical presuppositions through a radical reduction, Derrida interrogates whether this very desire for purification relies on the ultimate metaphysical presupposition: the determination of being as presence.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The analysis begins by locating the 'germinal structure' of Husserl's thought in the distinction between expression and indication. Husserl's project is framed as a quest for a 'theory of knowledge' that is rigorously presuppositionless, stripping away the empirical baggage of psychology and natural science. To achieve this, Husserl must stabilize the concept of the Sign. He posits a 'double sense' (Doppelsinn) where Expression is isolated as the vehicle of pure logical meaning, distinct from the indicative functions of communication. \n\nDerrida, however, executes a dialectical inversion. He asks if this phenomenological vigilance—this attempt to escape 'degenerate' metaphysics—is not secretly governed by 'authentic' metaphysics. The governing law of Husserl's system, the 'Principle of All Principles' (originary intuition), equates truth with the 'living present' or 'presence-in-person' of the object. Thus, the move to separate Expression (associated with presence and meaning) from Indication (associated with absence and empirical mediation) is not a neutral description but a metaphysical decision. Phenomenology does not overcome metaphysics; it attempts to restore it in its purest form as the philosophy of presence.",
        "interpretive_notes": "Derrida is setting a trap here. He grants Husserl the rigor of the reduction but shows that the reduction's *telos* is the preservation of Presence. The distinction Expression/Indication is the tactical maneuver used to protect Presence from the 'outside' (indication). Note how 'Presence' is treated as a Compressive Necessity—it is the point towards which all phenomenological lines converge."

To isolate a pure grammar of logic, Husserl performs a reduction, bracketing the factual existence of the world to focus on the 'epistemological value' of meaning.\n\nHowever, a tension immediately arises. This reduction, which claims to step outside of metaphysics, is driven by a desire for 'Presence'—the 'principle of all principles' where meaning is given in immediate intuition. We trace how this desire for self-identical presence transforms phenomenology not into the destruction of metaphysics, but into its restoration or completion.

It further analyzes Husserl's decision to subordinate the general essence of language to a 'Pure Logical Grammar,' thereby establishing Presence as the exclusive telos of meaning.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The analysis moves from the static opposition of Expression and Indication into the dynamic machinery required to sustain 'Ideality.' We discover that for an ideal object (a logical truth) to exist, it must be radically independent of any specific worldly moment—it must be 'non-mundane.' However, this independence paradoxically relies on the possibility of infinite 'Repetition.' The guarantor of this infinite capacity is identified as the 'Living Present' (the self-presence of transcendental life).\n\nHere, the dialectic takes a sharp turn. Derrida exposes that phenomenology is 'tormented from the inside.' The Living Present, which is supposed to secure unity, is found to be structurally 'fissured' by two necessary movements: 'Retention' (Time) and 'Appresentation' (Intersubjectivity). These are not external accidents but internal conditions. Retention introduces the 'non-now' into the Now; Appresentation introduces the opaque 'other' into the self. Thus, the condition of Presence is, strictly speaking, a form of Non-Presence or 'Non-Life.'\n\nFinally, the text interrogates the 'decision' to restrict the study of signs to 'Pure Logical Grammar.' Husserl creates a hierarchy where the 'telos' (goal) of language is Logic, and Logic is defined by Presence. By framing language this way, the 'communicative' (indicative) aspects are surgically removed not just as empirical accidents, but as threats to the purity of the logical *a priori*.",
        "interpretive_notes": "Key shift: Presence is no longer just a static 'given'; it is now a *produced* effect of Repetition. The 'Fissure a priori' is the central PML operation here—an expansive necessity that splits a compressive term from within."

        "conceptual_narrative": "The analysis begins by interrogating the engine of truth: **Ideality**. For a meaning to be true, it cannot be bound to a single moment; it must be repeatable as the *same* indefinitely. This mastery of time is what Husserl calls 'salvation.'\n\nTo achieve this, the ideal object must be 'irreal'—detached from reell (physical) consciousness. The medium that seemingly allows this detachment while maintaining 'living presence' is the **Voice** (Phonē), rooted in the concept of **Life** (Lebendigkeit).\n\nHowever, a dialectical tension emerges here. Phenomenology claims to be a philosophy of Life, yet it must rigorously separate **Mundane Life** (empirical, psychological) from **Transcendental Life** (the absolute source of meaning). Husserl posits a **Parallelism**: the transcendental ego and the empirical ego are distinct, yet they coincide point-for-point. The difference between them is 'nothing'—no ontological substance separates them—yet this 'nothing' is the sole condition for the **Transcendental Reduction**.\n\nDerrida suggests that this reliance on the unity of the word 'Life' creates a hidden passage—a metaphorical contamination—where the empirical constantly informs the transcendental, threatening the very purity the system seeks to compressively secure.",

By distinguishing the act of imagining (which is absolutely certain and present) from the imagined object (which is neutralized and non-existent), Husserl attempts to secure a realm where signs function purely as expression without empirical contamination.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic advances from the general bifurcation of the sign into a specific structural mechanism: the role of Imagination in preserving Self-Presence. Husserl faces a crisis: if the sign always involves indication (pointing to something not present), how can the solitary subject communicate with itself without introducing foreignness? The solution is the 'reduction' of the word to an image.\n\nDerrida uncovers a 'slip' in Husserl's text where signs are equated with indications, threatening the whole enterprise. To counter this, Husserl invokes 'Hinzeigen' (monstration/pointing-towards-sense) as distinct from 'Anzeigen' (indication/pointing-towards-existence). In the solitary monologue, we do not use real words; we use 'represented' words. This leads to a crucial scission within existence itself.\n\nThe 'imagined word' (the object) is neutralized; it does not exist empirically, and thus it cannot 'indicate' worldly existence. However, the 'imagination of the word' (the act) possesses absolute, indubitable existence within the stream of consciousness. By anchoring meaning in the 'act' of imagining rather than the 'object' imagined, Husserl hopes to maintain a closed loop of presence where the subject is immediately present to its own meaning, bypassing the treacherous mediation of the world. The sign is thus reduced to a 'floater'—phenomenologically safe because it is empirically dead.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk is pivotal for establishing the 'phenomenological voice.' The move to Phantasie (imagination) is what allows Husserl to claim that Expression is 'productive' while Indication is merely 'reproductive.' Note the emergence of 'Hinzeigen'—a form of reference that claims to bypass the gap of indication. Derrida is setting the trap: if the 'image' is necessary for presence, then 'representation' (re-presentation) is at the heart of presence, which contradicts the immediacy Husserl claims."

        "summary": "This section analyzes Husserl's teleological reliance on 'perfect expressions' (fulfilled meanings) to isolate the essence of language, alongside the critical distinction between Presentation (Gegenwärtigung) and Re-presentation (Vergegenwärtigung). Derrida argues that phenomenology rests entirely on the absolute heterogeneity of these two categories to avoid psychologism. However, he prepares the ground to demonstrate that 'perception does not exist' in this pure form; rather, the structure of the sign (re-presentation) is inextricably woven into the heart of the originary. The analysis also draws a parallel with Saussure's internalization of the 'acoustic image,' reinforcing the move to a solitary, non-physical sphere of meaning.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic deepens from the general 'Solitary Life' to the specific structural requirements of that solitude. To maintain the purity of Expression, Husserl must enforce a compressive 'Absolute Heterogeneity' between the originary intuition of an object (Presentation) and its symbolic repetition (Re-presentation). This distinction is the firewall protecting Phenomenology from Empiricism and Psychology. \n\nHowever, the text initiates a pivotal sublation: if the Sign is necessary for meaning, and the Sign is a Re-presentation, then the presence of meaning is always already contaminated by Re-presentation. Derrida asserts that the 'Pure Presentation' is a metaphysical mirage; the 'beginning' is always already a repetition (Trace). This insight exposes the 'Complicity' between Phenomenology and Classical Metaphysics—both rely on the myth of an unmediated Now. Saussure’s concept of the 'acoustic image' serves as a corroborating witness, showing how linguistics, like phenomenology, attempts to secure an internal, ideal realm by excluding the physical body of the sign.",
        "interpretive_notes": "The citation of Saussure is strategic. Just as Husserl brackets the 'physical word' to find the 'spiritual meaning' in soliloquy, Saussure brackets 'phonation' to find the 'acoustic image.' Both operations are reductive moves to secure a realm of pure ideality. Derrida's claim that 'perception does not exist' is not a denial of experience, but a denial of *immediate, self-identical* presence without the mediation of the sign."

To maintain the purity of this inner sanctuary, Husserl must enforce a rigorous border control: the 'absolute heterogeneity' between Presentation (immediate intuition of the object) and Re-presentation (memory, image, or sign of the object).\n\nIf this border falls, the entire phenomenological project is compromised because 'truth' relies on the possibility of returning to a pure, originary source (the 'Principle of Principles'). However, the dialectic of the internal voice reveals a fissure. If the internal voice—the medium of auto-affection—operates like a sign (even a fulfilled one), it participates in the structure of Re-presentation. Derrida leverages this to invert the hierarchy: rather than Re-presentation being a faded copy of Presentation, the structure of Re-presentation (deferral, difference) is found to be the condition of possibility for any Presentation whatsoever.\n\nThis move dissolves the stability of the 'Living Present.' If the 'Now' is constituted by its difference from the 'No-longer' and the 'Not-yet,' then 'pure perception'—the unmediated grasp of the present—is a metaphysical fiction. Phenomenology, by clinging to this fiction of presence, reveals itself not as the overcoming of classical metaphysics, but as its restoration and culmination. The 'acoustic image' of Saussure is invoked here to show a parallel attempt to internalize the sign, yet even this internalization cannot escape the logic of the trace.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk contains the explicit thesis statement of Derrida's deconstruction: 'Perception does not exist.' This is not an empirical denial of sensory experience, but a transcendental claim that the 'pure' immediacy Husserl requires is structurally impossible. Note the strategic use of Saussure: Derrida shows that both Husserl and Saussure try to reduce the material/external side of language to save the purity of the internal concept, yet this reduction paradoxically highlights that the internal is structured like a language (re-presentation)."

Husserl attempts to maintain a rigid barrier between 'actual' communication (indication, reality) and 'solitary' discourse (representation, imagination). He posits that in soliloquy, one merely 'pretends' to communicate. \n\nHowever, the analysis reveals a fatal flaw in this separation: the structure of Repetition (Iterability). For a sign to be a sign, it cannot be a singular, empirical event; it must be recognizable across diverse instances. This requires a 'formal identity' or Ideality. \n\nThis necessity of Repetition subverts the priority of Presence. If every sign implies an infinite possibility of repetition, then 'actual' discourse is structurally identical to 'represented' discourse. Representation is not an accident added to reality; it is constitutive of the sign itself. Thus, the distinction between the 'Real' (Presentation) and the 'Imaginary' (Re-presentation) collapses. Metaphysics is exposed as the 'obstinate desire' to save Presence by reducing the Sign to a derivative status, yet the Sign's very operation erases the Presence it is meant to serve.",

While Husserl asserts that solitary discourse is merely an imaginary representation of communication—lacking the purpose of indication—this analysis demonstrates that the structural condition of any sign is its repeatability (iterability). Because a sign must be recognizable across diverse empirical moments to function as a sign, it inherently participates in ideality and representation. Consequently, 'actual' communication is already structured by the same repetitive representation as 'imaginary' monologue. The rigid dichotomy between reality and representation collapses, revealing that the defense of this distinction serves only to protect the metaphysical desire for pure Presence against the eroding force of the Sign.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The inquiry begins by examining Husserl's claim that internal discourse is a 'fiction' where the subject merely pretends to communicate. This posits a binary: external communication is 'real' and indicative; internal monologue is 'representative' and non-indicative. However, by analyzing the ontology of the Sign itself, a contradiction emerges. A sign cannot be a singular, unique empirical event; if it happened only once, it would not be a sign. It requires a formal identity that survives repetition. This necessity of Repetition (Iterability) introduces Ideality into the very heart of the Sign. Therefore, every instance of language—whether communicative or solitary—is constituted by a structure of representation (standing-for). The separation between 'real' language and 'represented' language dissolves because 'reality' in language is always already constituted by the possibility of repetition. The attempt to maintain this separation is identified not as a phenomenological necessity, but as a metaphysical anxiety: the desire to preserve a pure, unmediated Presence from the derivative 'threat' of the Sign.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk marks the critical pivot where Derrida (via the interpreter) uses the concept of 'Iterability' (though not explicitly named, described here as 'structure of repetition') to sublate the distinction between Fact and Fiction. The logic moves from the properties of the Sign to the destruction of the Metaphysics of Presence. The 'difference' between reality and representation is exposed as a construct to save Presence."

It cannot be a singular, unrepeatable event. This structural necessity—Iterability—means that the sign is always already a 're-presentation' of an ideal form, even the very first time it is used. \n\nTherefore, the Subject's 'actual' speech is discovered to be grounded in the exact same mechanism as the 'imaginary' speech he despised: Repetition. The 'Reality' of the speaking subject is sublated by the 'Ideality' of the system he uses. We witness the birth of 'Primordial Repetition'—a force that precedes the distinction between the real and the fictional. The metaphysical desire to keep them separate is revealed as a desire to protect the illusion of pure Presence from the contamination of the Sign.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk contains the famous argument that 'A sign is never an event.' This is the death knell for the 'Living Present' as a simple, self-contained point. If the sign is structurally repeatable, then 'trace' and 'difference' inhabit the very heart of the 'now.' The logic shifts from the compressive necessity of the Ego (I am here) to the expansive necessity of the Trace (I am already repeated/other)."

Husserl argues that in solitary life, one only 'pretends' to communicate; the acts are present, so pointing to them is purposeless. Derrida counters by locating the essence of the Sign not in presence, but in 'Iterability' (repetition). Because a sign must be repeatable to be a sign at all, it structurally relies on representation (ideality) from the very start. Consequently, the hard line between 'real' discourse and 'represented' discourse collapses: 'reality' in language is already constituted by the structure of representation.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The analysis begins with Husserl's attempt to firewall the purity of the self. He asserts that in the 'solitary life of the soul,' communication is merely a fiction—a representation (*Vorstellung*)—because the subject possesses immediate access to their own psychic acts. Indication is superfluous here; it lacks purpose (*telos*).\n\nHowever, Derrida seizes upon the concept of Representation to invert the system. He argues that Husserl treats representation as an accident—a coat worn by language only when it steps out into the world. But what defines a Sign? A sign cannot be a singular, irreversible empirical event. If a word occurred only once, it would not be a word. A sign must be an *ideality*: a form capable of being recognized across infinite repetitions. \n\nThis necessity of Repetition (Iterability) means that the Sign is *always already* a representation of itself. It is never purely 'present' in the way a physical crash might be; it functions only because it is a copy of a code. Therefore, the structure of 'fiction' (representation without immediate presence) is actually the foundational structure of 'truth' (language). The distinction between 'real' communication and 'imaginary' soliloquy dissolves because language *is* the impossibility of pure reality distinct from representation. To restore the power of the Sign is, paradoxically, to erase the metaphysical concept of the Sign, which was built precisely to subordinate representation to presence.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk introduces the pivotal concept of 'Iterability' (though implied, the logic of repetition is explicit here). The key dialectical move is the shift from 'Representation as derivative' (Husserl) to 'Representation as constitutive' (Derrida).

Husserl maintains that talking to oneself is a charade—a 'representation' where no real communication occurs because the self is already fully present to the self. Here, 'Representation' is used pejoratively as a mere image of reality.\n\nHowever, the dialectic shifts violently when we examine the machinery of the Sign. A sign cannot be a singular, unique event; if it happened only once, it would not be a sign. It must be repeatable to be understood. This 'Iterability' is the condition of possibility for all language. \n\nThis leads to a startling inversion. If every sign relies on a repeatable ideal form to function, then every instance of language usage—whether communicating with another or talking to oneself—is inherently a 're-presentation' of that form. We are never in the 'pure now' of a unique event; we are always operating within the structure of Repetition.\n\nThe distinction between 'Real' communication and 'Imaginary' monologue dissolves. Both are woven from the same fabric of Repetition. The 'Living Present' (the anchor of Husserl's system) is exposed as a secondary effect—a stability generated by the rapid oscillation of repetition—rather than an absolute origin. The Sign does not merely represent a pre-existing Presence; Repetition constitutes the illusion of Presence.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk introduces the concept of 'Iterability' (though the word appears more explicitly in 'Limited Inc', the logic is here). It marks the transition from 'Phenomenology of Presence' to 'Grammatology of Writing/Trace'. The key move is the 'Inversion of Origin': usually, we think Presence -> Sign -> Repetition. Derrida argues Repetition (Iterability) -> Sign -> Effect of Presence. This sublates the 'Soliloquy' because the solitary ego is no longer the master of meaning but a product of the linguistic system."

Derrida argues that because every sign must be repeatable to function as a sign (ideality), the structure of representation is not an accident added to presence but the constitutive condition of the sign itself. Consequently, the boundary between reality and representation collapses, revealing that 'presence' is merely an effect of repetition.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic advances by scrutinizing the solitary subject's relation to the sign. Husserl claims that in the 'solitary life of the soul,' one does not communicate (indicate) but only 'represents' oneself as speaking. He relies on a stark division: actual communication involves the external world (indication), while solitary discourse is a harmless fiction, a mere imagination of communication where the subject remains fully present to itself. \n\nDerrida destabilizes this by analyzing the 'Sign' itself. For a phoneme or grapheme to be a sign, it cannot be a unique, irreversible empirical event; it must be an 'ideal form' capable of infinite repetition. This 'Structure of Repetition' means that every sign, even in its first instance, is already a re-presentation of an ideal form. \n\nThis leads to a critical inversion: Representation is not a secondary image of a primary reality. Instead, 'Primordial Representation' (repetition) is the condition for any reality of the sign whatsoever. Therefore, the distinction between 'real' communication and 'imaginary' soliloquy dissolves. Both are grounded in the same repetitive structure. The 'presence' Husserl tries to save is revealed to be an effect generated by repetition, and the attempt to isolate a pure, non-representative 'Now' is structurally impossible within language.",
        "interpretive_notes": "Key German terms: 'Vorstellung' (representation/presentation), 'Vergegenwärtigung' (making-present/re-presentation), 'Repräsentation' (substitution). Derrida links these: Ideality implies Repetition, and Repetition implies Representation. The 'Erasure of the Sign' refers to the paradox where affirming the sign's true nature (repetition) destroys its traditional metaphysical definition (derivative of presence)."

        "conceptual_narrative": "The analysis begins with Husserl's claim that in solitary life, one does not 'indicate' anything to oneself because self-presence is immediate; one only 'imagines' communicating. This sets up a binary: Actual Communication (Objective/Indicative) vs. Represented Communication (Subjective/Imaginative). Derrida destabilizes this by examining the condition of possibility for any sign whatsoever. For a sign to be a sign, it must be repeatable (iterable) across diverse empirical moments. This 'Ideality' of the sign form necessitates that every instance of language—even the most 'actual' or 'real'—is structurally a Representation (Vergegenwärtigung). Consequently, the 'real' is always already infected by the 'imaginary' structure of repetition. The distinction Husserl relies upon to save the purity of Presence collapses, revealing that to restore the Sign to its proper place is, paradoxically, to destroy the metaphysical concept of the Sign which was built on the primacy of Presence.",

Husserl argues that in soliloquy, the subject only imagines speaking to themselves, as immediate self-presence renders actual communication superfluous. Derrida counters by demonstrating that the very structure of the Sign—whether in monologue or dialogue—necessitates Ideality, which is constituted by the possibility of infinite Repetition (Iterability). Because a sign must be repeatable to be a sign, it is structurally constituted by representation (re-presentation). Consequently, the hard distinction between 'real' presence and 'imaginary' representation collapses; 'actual' discourse is just as dependent on the structure of representation as 'imaginary' discourse.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The analysis begins with the Subjection of the Solitary Life. Husserl attempts to secure a realm of Pure Sense by defining solitary discourse as a zone where the Subject is immediately present to itself, requiring no indication. Here, speech is reduced to mere imagination (Vergegenwärtigung)—a 'pretend' communication. \n\nHowever, this defensive compression triggers an expansive reversal. Derrida seizes upon the nature of the Sign itself. For a sign to function as a sign (and not a one-time empirical accident), it must possess a formal identity that survives repetition across diverse moments. This Ideality of the sign means it is structurally constituted by Repetition. \n\nIf the sign is inherently repetitive, it is inherently re-presentative. It stands in for itself. Therefore, the 'reality' of actual communication and the 'fiction' of solitary monologue share the exact same structural root: Iterability. The attempt to ground the sign in a 'Living Present' fails because the sign's very condition of possibility—repetition—introduces a 'death' or 'non-presence' into the heart of the present. The barrier between Reality and Representation is thus revealed to be permeable, sublated by the primordial structure of the Trace.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk contains the core argument of 'iterability' (though the term is more famous in 'Signature Event Context', the logic is present here). The key move is using Husserl's own criteria (Ideality) against his conclusion (Presence). If the sign is ideal, it must be repeatable; if repeatable, it is not purely 'present' but relies on a return of the same, which blurs the line between the first time (reality) and the second time (representation)."

The analysis reveals that Ideality—the guarantee of truth and scientific objectivity—is structurally identical to the possibility of infinite repetition. Consequently, the 'Universal Form of Presence' does not secure the immortality of the subject but rather implies its necessary disappearance (Death). The logic of the Sign is thus unveiled as a fundamental 'relation to death,' meaning that the very assertion 'I am' structurally contains the confession 'I am mortal.'",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic penetrates the core of the 'Living Present.' Previously, the Sign was a secondary tool used by a self-present Subject. Now, the analysis reveals that for any 'Present' to exist as an identity (to be recognized as 'the same'), it must be repeatable. This **Primacy of Repetition** destabilizes the origin: the 'original' presentation is actually an effect of its own repeatability. \n\nThis leads to a startling sublation of 'Life.' The philosophical desire for **Ideality** (truth that lasts forever) requires a form of Presence that is independent of any specific empirical moment or subject. If the form of the Present is universal, it continues without 'me.' Therefore, to think the 'I am' in terms of truth/ideality is to think the possibility of my own absence. The **Universal Presence** necessitates **Subjective Death**. The Sign, as the vehicle of this repetition, is not just a proxy for a missing object; it is the structural inscription of death within life. The 'I am' is no longer the Cartesian foundation of immortality but the site where presence and death are paradoxically identical.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk contains the famous Derridean inversion where 're-presentation' (repetition) grounds 'presentation' (presence). The logic moves from Compressive Presence to Expansive Repetition, and then synthesizes them: Presence *is* Repetition. This introduces 'Death' not as a biological event, but as a transcendental condition of the Sign."

He argues that because the very structure of the Sign depends on Repetition (Ideality), and Repetition is structurally indistinguishable from the imaginative power of Fiction (Phantasie), the boundary between truth and fiction collapses. If the sign is 'originarily worked over by fiction,' then Husserl's attempt to isolate a pure, non-communicative 'Expression' inside the self fails. Derrida then examines Husserl's argument that indication is 'useless' (zwecklos) in self-consciousness because the self is present to itself in the absolute proximity of the 'blink of an eye' (Augenblick). Derrida suggests that this absolute proximity would render not just indication, but all signs—including expression—superfluous, thereby threatening the very possibility of phenomenological discourse.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic moves from the *compressive* attempt to isolate Truth from Fiction to the *expansive* realization that Truth (Ideality) is constituted by the very mechanism of Fiction (Repetition). Initially, Phenomenology attempts to treat Representation as a mere 'garment' or accident added to the naked truth of the Subject. However, the analysis reveals that the Subject cannot speak—even to itself—without Representation. Discourse *is* its own self-representation. This collapses the interior/exterior binary. The narrative then focuses on the 'Instant' (Augenblick) as the citadel of Presence. Husserl claims the self is so immediately present to itself that it has no need for signs (indications). Derrida exposes this as a fatal overreach: if the self is a unified instant without difference, it cannot support the structure of Meaning at all. Thus, the 'uselessness' of the sign becomes a symptom of the sign's fundamental incompatibility with the metaphysics of pure Presence.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk is pivotal because it deconstructs the 'Principle of Principles' (Intuition/Presence). Derrida uses the term 'Phantasie' (Imagination) to bridge the gap between Ideality and Fiction. The key move is the 'argument from uselessness': Husserl argues signs are useless because of presence; Derrida argues presence makes signs impossible. This sets the stage for the introduction of 'Time' as the force that fractures the 'Instant.'"

        "summary": "Derrida interrogates Husserl's distinction between 'actual' and 'fictional' language usage within the solitary life of the soul. He argues that if the sign is constituted by an originary structure of repetition, the boundary between reality and fiction collapses, threatening the isolation of pure Expression. The analysis culminates in Husserl's claim that internal communication is 'useless' (Zwecklos) because the self is present to itself in the absolute proximity of the 'blink of an eye' (Augenblick).",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic moves deeper into the nature of the Sign within the 'solitary life of the soul.' We previously established that Soliloquy requires a reduction of the sign to 'Phantasie' (imagination). Now, we face the paradox that this reduction to fiction is meant to yield the absolute truth of logical Meaning.\n\nHusserl attempts to maintain a rigorous border: inside the soul, 'meaning' is actual, but 'communication' is merely fictional (I only *pretend* to speak to myself). He treats actuality as a mere 'empirical piece of clothing' worn by the soul.\n\nHowever, the analysis reveals a fatal flaw. If every sign is structurally defined by its iterability—its capacity for infinite repetition—then the sign is 'originarily worked over by fiction.' There is no structural difference between a sign used 'actually' and a sign used 'fictionally.' If the sign is essentially repetitive, then Representation is not an accident added to Presence; it is the condition of Presence.\n\nThis leads to the desperate defensive maneuver of the *Zwecklosigkeit* (purposelessness). Husserl argues that I do not *need* to speak to myself because I am already fully present to myself in the 'blink of an eye' (Augenblick). The Sign is rejected as superfluous because Presence is assumed to be absolute and instantaneous. The stage is set for the deconstruction of this 'instant' as a temporal impossibility.",
        "interpretive_notes": "Key terms: *Phantasievorstellungen* (Imaginative representations), *Zwecklosigkeit* (Purposelessness/Uselessness), *Augenblick* (Blink of an eye/Instant). The crucial move here is Derrida's inversion: Husserl says representation is an accident of communication; Derrida says discourse *is* self-representation. The 'clothing' metaphor underscores Husserl's dualism (soul/meaning vs. body/expression)."

Husserl distinguishes these from 'objective' scientific expressions, claiming the 'I' relies on the immediate presence of the speaking subject for its meaning. Derrida deconstructs this by demonstrating that for the 'I' to function as a linguistic sign at all (to have 'Bedeutung'), it must possess the structure of ideality and iterability. This implies that the 'I' must remain intelligible even in the radical absence of the speaker. Consequently, the possibility of the subject's death is not extrinsic to the 'I' but is the structural condition of its possibility. The statement 'I am' is thus shown to be structurally equivalent to 'I am dead,' as its meaningfulness survives the extinction of the intention that animated it.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The analysis moves from the general problem of writing to the specific instance of the 'I'. Derrida challenges Husserl's attempt to isolate a 'subjective' zone of language (occasional expressions) safe from the drift of writing. \n\nHusserl posits that 'I' realizes its meaning through immediate self-representation in solitary discourse. Derrida counters by applying the rigorous logic of the Sign established earlier: if 'I' is a word, it is an ideality. If it is an ideality, it must be repeatable (iterable). If it is repeatable, it must function in the absence of its object (the subject).\n\nThis leads to a startling inversion: the 'I', usually the bastion of pure presence and life, is revealed to be constituted by the 'possibility of death.' Just as I can understand a text written by a dead author, I can understand 'I' without the intuition of the living subject. Therefore, the 'I' operates on a 'testimonial' structure—it signifies only because it can outlive the speaker. The 'I am' does not prove immediate life; rather, it proves that the subject has entered the order of the Sign, which is the order of death-as-survival. The distinction between 'occasional' and 'objective' expressions collapses because all expressions share this root in the 'death' of the signifier's empirical attachment.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk contains the famous inversion where Derrida derives 'I am' from 'I am dead.' This is not a gothic metaphor but a strict logical deduction from Husserl's own premises regarding ideality. If meaning (Bedeutung) is ideal, it is independent of empirical existence. Therefore, the meaning of 'I' cannot depend on the life of the speaker. This forces the 'Living Present' to acknowledge its debt to the 'Trace' or the 'Gramme' (writing). The 'Zero-point' of subjectivity is revealed to be a 'Zero-point' in a different sense: a void or placeholder that can be filled by anyone, effectively anonymizing the most personal of pronouns."

        "summary": "In this pivotal analysis, Derrida examines Husserl's 'Pure Logical Grammar' to demonstrate that Meaning (Bedeutung) is structurally independent of Knowledge or Intuition. While Husserl intends this separation to secure the objectivity of logic (allowing us to discuss 'square circles' meaningfully), Derrida radicalizes this independence. He argues that if Meaning can function without the presence of the object or the subject, this 'absence' is not merely a tolerated accident but the constitutive condition of the Sign. The sign is defined by the 'Death of the Writer'—the structural necessity that the message remains intelligible even if the sender and the referent are radically absent.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic moves from the *compressive* security of Phenomenology—which sought to ground the Sign in the fullness of Intuition—to the *expansive* realization of Structural Absence.\n\nFirst, we engage with Husserl's **Pure Logical Grammar**. Husserl creates a compressive distinction between *Widersinnigkeit* (logical contradiction, like a 'square circle') and *Unsinn* (pure nonsense, like 'abracadabra'). Crucially, the 'square circle' possesses Meaning (*Bedeutung*) despite lacking a possible Object. This proves that Meaning does not derive its validity from the presence of the object or the fulfillment of intuition. It stands alone in the ideality of its form.\n\nHusserl views this separation as provisional—a waiting room for the eventual 'Fulfillment' (*Erfüllung*) where Meaning and Intuition fuse into a unity. He posits that while Meaning *can* exist without Intuition, its *telos* is that fusion.\n\nDerrida, however, executes a sublation of this Telos. If the Sign is structurally capable of functioning without the Object (as proven by the 'square circle'), and if it must be repeatable (*iterable*) to be a sign at all, then **Radical Absence** is its foundation, not Presence. The distinction between 'statement about perception' and 'statement in solitude' collapses because the structure of the sign requires that it remain intelligible even if the perception is false or the perceiver is dead.\n\nThus, the 'Death of the Writer' is not an empirical event but a logical necessity. For a text to mean anything, it must be capable of surviving the total extinction of its author and its referent. Meaning is born not from the 'Living Present' but from the structural possibility of Death.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk contains the famous 'Death of the Author' argument in its rigorous phenomenological form. Note the shift in polarity: Husserl uses the independence of meaning to *compress* logic into a pure science; Derrida uses the same independence to *expand* the sign into a necessary void (absence of presence). The concept of 'Gegenstandlosigkeit' (objectlessness) is transformed from a logical curiosity into the ontological ground of language."

Derrida demonstrates that the 'I,' categorized by Husserl as an 'essentially occasional' expression dependent on the speaking subject's presence, actually relies on the same structure of ideality and repetition as all other signs. This leads to the radical conclusion that the meaning of 'I'—and thus the assertion 'I am'—structurally necessitates the possibility of the subject's death. The intelligibility of the 'I' does not derive from the living presence of the ego, but from the linguistic system's ability to function in the absolute absence of the speaker.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic moves from the general structure of the Sign (as established in previous chunks) to the specific, privileged locus of the Subject: the 'I'. \n\nWe begin by revisiting the nature of Writing. Writing is defined by the absence of the subject—the text signifies even when the author is gone or dead. Derrida asks: is this absence an accident of writing, or the truth of all language, including 'live' speech? \n\nThe investigation turns to Husserl's treatment of 'essentially occasional expressions' (like 'I', 'here', 'now'). Husserl argues that these words only have meaning when animated by the living presence of the speaker. For Husserl, 'I' means the person currently speaking; without that intuition, the meaning seems to falter.\n\nHowever, we expose a contradiction in Husserl's own logic. Husserl defines Meaning (Bedeutung) as Ideal—universally communicable and repeatable. If the meaning of 'I' changed completely every time a new person spoke, it would not be a word but a chaos. For 'I' to be a sign at all, it must possess an ideal form that remains identical across different instances.\n\nThis leads to the crucial sublation: The 'I' of the Soliloquy (pure self-presence) is sublated by the 'I' of the Sign (pure ideality). If 'I' is a sign, it must be readable and understandable even if the speaker is unknown or dead. Just as a mathematical truth does not depend on the mathematician's life, the meaning of 'I' does not depend on the subject's life.\n\nConsequently, the 'I am' does not prove my existence through immediacy. Instead, the very possibility of saying 'I' inscribes my 'death' (my potential absence) into the statement. The sign allows the 'I' to function in my absence; therefore, the structure of the 'I' is the structure of a testament. The 'living present' is thus contaminated by the 'structural death' required for meaning to exist.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This is a pivotal moment where the 'Cogito' (I am) is deconstructed. The 'I am' is usually the bedrock of presence in Western philosophy. Derrida shows that 'I am' is a linguistic statement subject to the laws of writing (iterability). Therefore, 'I am' implies 'I am dead' (or 'I can be dead') as the condition of its own intelligibility. The distinction between 'normal' speech (presence) and 'abnormal' writing (absence) collapses."

        "summary": "In this decisive passage, the analysis confronts the teleological nature of Husserl's distinctions and announces the closure of metaphysics. Derrida demonstrates that the ideal of objective univocity is deferred to infinity, rendering the distinctions between expression and indication, or sign and non-sign, theoretically impossible to maintain in fact. This deferral reveals that the 'Infinite' in phenomenology is not a positive presence but a movement grounded in the 'relation to death.' Consequently, the history of metaphysics (defined as the history of Presence or the desire to hear-oneself-speak) is declared closed. The voice without différance—absolute self-presence—is revealed to be indistinguishable from absolute death. The text concludes by positing concepts like 'trace' and 'supplement' not as derivatives of a primordial origin, but as 'older' structures that constitute the origin itself, moving the inquiry beyond the system of Absolute Knowledge.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The movement begins with the collapse of the Ideal. We established previously that the Sign is structural; now we see that the 'Ideal' of pure expression is an infinite deferral. This means the boundaries defining Phenomenology (Expression vs. Indication) are 'purely teleological'—they essentially do not exist in the reality of the Living Present. \n\nThis collapse forces a re-evaluation of 'Infinity.' Husserl's infinite is merely indefinite (Kantian), whereas Hegel's is positive. However, Derrida sublates both: the true Infinite appears only through the 'relation to my-death.' Thus, 'Infinite Différance is finite.' \n\nThis paradox marks the 'Closure of Metaphysics.' If the goal of metaphysics is the Voice without Différance (Absolute Presence), achieving it would mean the cessation of life (Death). Therefore, Life requires Différance (absence/spacing). We enter a normative state of 'Non-Knowledge,' where the 'Trace' or 'Writing' is recognized as 'older' than the 'Origin.' The Origin is a retroactive effect of the Trace.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk contains the famous declaration of the 'Closure of Metaphysics.' Note the shift from 'Contexts' to 'Epochs': the entire history of philosophy is treated as a single epoch of Presence. The logic moves from 'Compressive Necessity' of a system to the 'Expansive Necessity' of the Trace which exceeds that system. The 'voice without différance' being 'alive and dead' is a classic dialectical identity of opposites."

        "summary": "This section marks the transition from the phenomenological critique to the closure of metaphysics. Derrida analyzes Husserl's admission that the 'objective expression' is practically impossible but remains a valid infinite ideal (a Kantian Idea). Derrida argues that deferring the purity of the distinction (between sign/non-sign, expression/indication) to infinity renders the system purely teleological. However, this deferral collapses the distinctions themselves: their possibility is revealed as their impossibility. The analysis then pivots to Hegel, suggesting that Absolute Knowledge represents the closure of the history of Presence. A 'voice without différance'—the ideal of self-presence—is shown to be indistinguishable from absolute death. Finally, the text suggests that the 'supplement' (writing, sign, trace), previously debased as accidental, is actually 'older' than the originary truth it was supposed to serve.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic reaches a critical singularity where the defense of the phenomenological system becomes its undoing. Husserl, faced with the expansive contamination of the 'Sign' into the 'Expression,' attempts a compressive maneuver: he exiles the purity of the distinction to an 'infinite ideal.' He admits that *in fact*, subjective and objective expressions are inextricably mixed, but *in principle*, the distinction remains as a goal (Telos). \n\nWe analyze this as the 'Teleological Deferral.' Husserl creates a gap between the Real (where distinctions fail) and the Ideal (where they hold). However, this gap is fatal. If the distinction between Expression and Indication is only an infinite task, then in the Living Present, that distinction is always already erased. The 'possibility' of the system relies on a condition (infinite purity) that is structurally impossible in the present. Thus, the condition of possibility becomes the condition of impossibility.\n\nThe narrative then confronts the 'Metaphysics of Presence' in its totality. Derrida contrasts Husserl's 'indefinite' infinity with Hegel's 'positive' infinity (Absolute Knowledge). While Hegel's system closes the circle, achieving the parousia of the Logos, this closure reveals a terrifying truth: a consciousness fully present to itself, a 'voice without différance,' is static and lifeless. It is 'at once absolutely alive and absolutely dead.'\n\nThis leads to the final inversion, the sublation of the 'Origin.' We traditionally view the Sign/Representation as a secondary fall from a primary Presence. But if Presence equals Death/Closure, and Life requires Différance, then the 'secondary' term (the Supplement, the Trace) is actually 'older' than the Origin. The structure of death/finitude is the precondition for the illusion of infinite presence. We end in a state of 'Non-Knowledge' (unheard-of thoughts), having moved beyond the system of Absolute Knowledge.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk contains the famous formulation 'The history of metaphysics is the absolute wanting-to-hear-itself speak.' It represents the move from 'deconstruction of Husserl' to 'general deconstruction of Western Metaphysics.' The logic shifts from analyzing specific contradictions (Expression vs. Indication) to analyzing the temporal structure of Truth itself (the 'older' trace)."

        "summary": "In this dense and climactic section, the analysis moves from the impossibility of objective expression to the 'closure' of the history of metaphysics. The text demonstrates that Husserl's ideal of a purely objective, univocal expression is a teleological structure necessarily deferred to infinity (in the Kantian sense of an indefinite progression). This deferral reveals a paradox: the distinctions essential to phenomenology (sign vs. non-sign, expression vs. indication) are impossible in fact and erased in principle. The analysis then pivots to the concept of 'Absolute Knowledge' and the 'Positive Infinite' (Hegel), arguing that the pure 'Voice' (presence to self) desired by metaphysics is, in its absolute purity, indistinguishable from Death. The 'closure' of metaphysics is the recognition that 'Infinite Différance' is actually finite, rooted in the relation to one's own death. Finally, the text opens toward 'unheard-of thoughts'—concepts like the Trace or Writing that are 'older' than the history of Being itself.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The arc of this passage describes the collapse of the 'Idea' as a guarantee of truth and its rebirth as the structure of mortality. \n\nWe begin with **Husserl's Defense**: He attempts to save the objectivity of meaning by positing it as an infinite ideal. Even if subjective expression fluctuates, it aims at an ideal, objective replacement. However, this replacement is 'deferred to infinity.' \n\nThis leads to the **Aporia of Distinctions**: Because the perfect separation (e.g., between expression and indication) is an infinite ideal, it never exists in fact. Consequently, the very possibility of these distinctions relies on their empirical impossibility. Their 'possibility is their impossibility.'\n\nThe narrative then engages **The Metaphysical Infinite**: Husserl's infinity is Kantian (indefinite), avoiding the 'Positive Infinite' of Hegel. However, the text argues that only by thinking the Positive Infinite (absolute self-presence) can we see the truth of Différance. \n\nThis reveals the **Secret of the Voice**: The absolute proximity of the voice to itself, the 'wanting-to-hear-itself-speak' that defines metaphysics, creates a closed loop. A voice without différance (without spacing, delay, or writing) is 'at once absolutely alive and absolutely dead.'\n\nThe movement concludes with **The Trace**: With the closure of the history of presence, we encounter concepts that are 'older' than the origin. The 'Trace' or 'Writing' is not a derivative modification of presence but the primordial violence (relation to death) that makes presence possible. The infinite is finite.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk represents the 'Self-Destruction' of the initial thesis (Subjective Expression) and the antithesis (Objective Indication) into a new, paradoxical Normative ground: the Trace. The 'Closure of Metaphysics' does not mean its cessation, but the exhaustion of its internal possibilities, revealing that its ultimate desire (Pure Presence) is a death drive. The logic here shifts from 'Compressive Necessity' of Presence to the 'Normative Necessity' of the Trace."

        "summary": "Derrida brings the analysis to its climax by deconstructing the temporal structure of Husserl's Idealism and declaring the 'closure' of metaphysics. He argues that Husserl's reliance on an 'infinite' ideal of objective expression renders all essential distinctions (sign vs. expression, reality vs. representation) purely teleological—they are goals that are never reached, effectively erasing them in reality. This leads to the realization that 'infinite différance' is grounded in finitude and the relation to death. Finally, Derrida posits that the 'Supplement' (Trace, Writing) is not a derivative modification of Presence, but is 'older' than the Origin itself, marking the closure of the history of Being as Presence.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The arc moves from **Teleological Deferral** to **Structural Closure**, and finally to **Originary Antecedence**.\n\n1.  **The Teleological Horizon:** We begin with Husserl's admission that the perfect, objective expression is infinitely distant. Derrida interprets this to mean that the entire system of phenomenological distinctions (Expression/Indication) is suspended on a 'to infinity.' They do not exist *now*; they are only promised. This creates a paradox where the *possibility* of the distinction is its *impossibility* in fact.\n\n2.  **The Finitude of the Infinite:** Derrida contrasts this with Hegel. He argues that the appearance of infinite différance is only possible through a relation to **Death**. Paradoxically, infinite différance is finite. It is the finitude of life relating to itself. This collapses the opposition between finite and infinite, revealing that the 'Absolute Knowledge' of metaphysics is a closed history—the history of the 'wanting-to-hear-itself-speak.'\n\n3.  **The Anteriority of the Trace:** The analysis concludes by stepping 'beyond' this closure. We enter a space where we 'no longer know.' Here, the hierarchy is inverted: the Trace (re-presentation, sign, writing) is not an accident that befalls a pure Origin (Presence). Instead, the Trace is 'older' than the Origin. The 're-turn' is the condition of the 'start.' Truth relates to its own death as its origin.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk contains the famous declaration that 'The history of metaphysics is the absolute wanting-to-hear-itself speak.' The logic shifts here from internal critique to a topological inversion: what was 'secondary' (writing/death) is placed 'before' the 'primary' (speech/life). Note the use of 'Anteriority' logic: `Trace > Origin`."

        "summary": "This section marks the decisive collapse of the Husserlian phenomenological project into the 'Closure of Metaphysics.' Derrida demonstrates that Husserl's ideal of a purely objective expression—one free from subjective fluctuation—is an 'infinite task' (Kant's Idea). Because this ideal is infinitely deferred, the essential distinctions that uphold phenomenology (fact/essence, sign/intuition, reality/representation) lose their rigorous boundaries. Derrida argues that this 'infinite différance' is not a positive theological infinity (Hegel's Absolute) but is rooted in the finite 'relation to death.' The desire for a 'voice without différance' (pure self-presence) is revealed to be a desire for death, as a life without difference is static. The analysis concludes by positing the 'Trace' or 'Arch-Writing' as 'older' than the origin itself, signaling a move beyond the system of Absolute Knowledge.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectic reaches its critical breaking point. Previously, we saw the tension between Subjective Will and Objective Constraint resolved in 'Concrete Freedom.' However, Derrida now subjects this synthesis to a radical deconstruction. He begins by examining the 'Ideal of Objectivity' within Husserl. For Objectivity to be pure, it must completely exclude the subjective fluctuation of the 'occasional' expression. Husserl admits this is impossible in fact but retains it as an infinite 'Idea.' \n\nDerrida seizes upon this 'deferral to infinity.' If the guarantee of the distinction between the Sign (empirical) and the Essence (ideal) is infinitely deferred, then the distinction itself is strictly teleological—it does not exist in the 'Living Present.' Consequently, the entire system of oppositions (Expression vs. Indication, Reality vs. Representation) collapses. \n\nThe narrative then shifts to the ontological status of this 'Infinity.' Husserl views it as an indefinite progress (Kant). Hegel viewed it as a positive parousia (God/Absolute). Derrida subulates both: he argues that the 'appearing of infinite différance' is only possible through the creature's 'relation to death.' Thus, the Infinite is not transcendent; it is the name of our Finitude. \n\nThis leads to the 'Closure of Metaphysics.' The history of philosophy is the desire for a 'Voice without Différance'—pure self-affection without the spacing of time or sign. But such a voice would be 'absolutely dead.' Therefore, the 'Trace' (the necessity of spacing/death) is revealed to be 'older' than the 'Origin' (Presence). We end not with a synthesis, but with an opening onto 'unheard-of thoughts' beyond the system of truth-as-presence.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk contains the famous pronouncement that 'Infinite Différance is Finite.' This is a crucial inversion of Hegelian logic. Where Hegel sees the Finite resolving into the Infinite Absolute, Derrida sees the Infinite as a projection of the Finite structure of mortality. The 'Voice'—the privileged medium of presence—is deconstructed: if it were truly immediate (no gap, no time, no différance), it would be indistinguishable from silence or death. This paradox (Life = Death) is the logic of the 'Arch-Trace.'"

        "summary": "This section marks the culmination of the deconstructive trajectory, moving from the critique of Husserl's infinite ideal of objectivity to the proclamation of the 'closure of metaphysics.' Derrida argues that Husserl's reliance on the 'Idea in the Kantian sense'—where perfect objectivity is an infinitely deferred goal—renders the essential distinctions of phenomenology (expression vs. indication, reality vs. representation) practically impossible. This infinite deferral reveals that the history of philosophy is the 'history of presence,' a desperate attempt to secure a stable origin. Derrida asserts that this history is now closed. Within this closure, the desire for a 'voice without différance' (pure self-presence) is exposed as a desire for death, since absolute presence equals absolute immobility. Consequently, the 'Trace' or 'Writing' is revealed not as secondary to presence, but as 'older' than the origin itself, constituting the condition of possibility for both life and meaning.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The analysis begins with the Sublimation of **Objectivity**. Husserl attempts to save the purity of the Sign and the Univocity of Expression by appealing to an **Idea in the Kantian Sense**: an infinite task. However, the analysis shows that this **Infinite Deferral** acts as a solvent; if the distinction is only valid 'at infinity,' it is valid 'nowhere' in lived reality. The normative possibility of the distinction becomes its factual impossibility.\n\nThis collapse leads to a radical re-evaluation of **History**. History is identified not as a neutral accumulation of time, but as the **Metaphysics of Presence**—the striving of the logos to hear itself speak without gap or delay. The text declares the **Closure** of this history. It is not an end in time, but the exhaustion of the conceptual resources of presence.\n\nIn this Closure, a new synthesis emerges: **Finitude**. The 'infinite différance' is revealed to be finite because it is grounded in the **Relation to Death**. The absolute proximity of the voice to itself (pure auto-affection without the 'outside') is indistinguishable from absolute death. Therefore, the **Trace** (the non-present, the supplement, writing) is not a modification of presence but is 'older' than presence. The movement concludes by positioning the **Unheard-of** (concepts beyond absolute knowledge) as the primordial ground which metaphysics had repressed.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk contains some of Derrida's most famous pronouncements, specifically regarding the 'closure of metaphysics' and the 'voice.' The logical move is strict: if presence requires time (retention), and retention introduces non-presence, then 'pure presence' eliminates time. If time is eliminated, life is eliminated. Thus, the dream of pure presence is the dream of death. This inverts the entire Husserlian project: the search for 'living meaning' is structurally a death drive."

He argues that the essential distinctions (expression/indication, reality/ideality) are deferred to infinity, which effectively erases them in both fact and principle. This deferral reveals that 'infinite différance' is structurally identical to 'finitude' and the 'relation to death.' Consequently, the history of Metaphysics—defined as the history of Presence and the desire to hear-oneself-speak—is declared 'closed.' In this closure, the hierarchy is inverted: the 'Sign,' 'Writing,' and 'Re-presentation' are no longer secondary derivatives but are revealed as 'older' than the 'Originary' presence itself. The 'Trace' is not a modification of presence, but the condition of its possibility.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectical arc reaches its shattering conclusion (or 'closure'). We began with the Subject's attempt to secure absolute Meaning through Soliloquy (compressive necessity). We saw this attempt destabilized by the expansive necessity of Time and the Sign. Now, the tension resolves into a new, paradoxical Normative ground.\n\nFirst, the text dismantles the 'Idea in the Kantian sense.' Husserl attempts to save the purity of language by claiming its perfect univocity is an infinite ideal. Derrida subverts this: if the distinction between Sign and Non-Sign is deferred to infinity, it is effectively null. The 'Idea' is not a guarantee of truth, but an admission of the 'erasure' of the distinction.\n\nSecond, this 'infinity' is re-read not as positive fullness (Hegel) but as 'différance.' However, Derrida makes the crucial move of identifying this infinite différance with *Finitude* itself. To differ infinitely is to be mortal. The 'Voice without différance'—the perfect self-presence Husserl desires—is identified as 'Absolute Death.' To be alive is to differ; to be fully present is to be dead.\n\nFinally, the 'History of Being' (Metaphysics) is seen as a closed epoch. We step 'beyond absolute knowledge.' Here, the terms 'Sign,' 'Trace,' and 'Re-presentation' cease to be secondary accidents that befall a pure origin. Instead, they are recognized as 'older' than the Origin. The 're-' of repetition is not after the 'present'; the 'present' is an effect of the 're-'.

        "summary": "This final movement analyzes the collapse of Husserl's essential distinctions into the 'closure of metaphysics.' Derrida demonstrates that Husserl's ideal of objective univocity is an 'inaccessible ideal' deferred to infinity, rendering the distinctions between sign/non-sign and expression/indication purely teleological. This deferral creates an aporia where the possibility of the distinction is simultaneously its impossibility. The analysis culminates by revealing that the 'history of presence' is the history of the Voice 'wanting-to-hear-itself-speak.' This history is now closed. In this closure, 'Différance' appears not as a negative infinite, but as the 'finitude of life' related to death. Finally, the text posits the 'Trace' or 'Writing' as 'older' than the originary Presence, requiring a new mode of thought beyond Absolute Knowledge.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectical arc reaches its resolution by confronting the 'Ideal' that has sustained the phenomenological project. We began with the solitary subject attempting to secure meaning through the 'Voice' (Auto-affection). We saw this voice contaminated by Time and the Sign. Now, we see the consequences of that contamination on the 'Idea' of Truth itself.\n\nFirst, the Ideal of 'objective univocity' (perfect scientific expression) is revealed to be an 'infinite task.' Because it is infinite, the distinctions required to reach it (Expression vs. Indication) are never fully present; they are deferred. This creates a strange logic: the distinctions are 'erased' in reality but maintained as a 'task.' Their possibility is their impossibility.\n\nSecond, the movement confronts the nature of this 'Infinity.' Husserl conceives it as an indefinite progress (Kantian), while Hegel conceives it as a positive totality. Derrida cuts through both by grounding the 'appearing of infinite différance' in 'my-death.' The infinite is not out there; it is the structural finitude of the living present. Différance is the relation to death.\n\nThird, this realization marks the 'Closure of Metaphysics.' Metaphysics is defined as the desire for the Voice (Presence) to hear itself absolutely. When this Voice is achieved without différance, it is indistinguishable from death. Thus, the history of Truth-as-Presence closes.\n\nFinally, we step 'beyond' this closure. We do not step into nonsense, but into a region where we 'no longer know' in the mode of metaphysics. We encounter the 'Trace' (or Writing) not as a derivative copy of Presence, but as the 'unheard-of' structure that is 'older' than Presence, older than the Origin, and older than History. The 'beginning' is shown to be a secondary effect of the Trace.",
        "interpretive_notes": "The phrase 'The possibility of the distinction is its impossibility' is the quintessential deconstructive formula (quasi-transcendental). It means that the very condition that allows a distinction to be thought (the deferral to infinity) is the same condition that prevents the distinction from ever being pure or rigorous in the present. The 'Closure' (Clôture) is distinct from the 'End' (Fin); metaphysics doesn't stop, but it has exhausted its structural possibilities, circling within its own limits. The 'Trace' being 'older' than the 'Origin' reverses the fundamental axiom of Western philosophy (that the Origin is first and the Sign is second)."

        "summary": "Derrida deconstructs Husserl's appeal to an 'idea in the Kantian sense' (infinite regulative telos) to save the objectivity of language from subjective fluctuation. The analysis exposes that the essential distinctions of phenomenology (expression vs. indication) are teleological structures that dissolve upon realization: their possibility is their impossibility. The text moves through a confrontation with Hegel, arguing that infinite différance can only appear through a relation to death. This marks the 'closure of metaphysics'—the exhaustion of the history of Being as Presence. The chunk concludes by positing the 'Trace' or 'Repetition' not as derived accidents, but as 'older' than the originary presence they supposedly modify.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The dialectical movement here reaches its critical breaking point, shifting from the internal critique of the sign to the 'Closure of Metaphysics.' Initially, Husserl attempts to stabilize the sign against the flux of subjective context by appealing to an 'Infinite Task'—the ideal replaceability of every subjective expression with an objective one. However, we analyze this 'Infinity' not as a positive fullness (Parousia), but as an indefinite deferral. \n\nThis reveals a devastating aporia: the 'essential distinctions' (Sign/Non-sign, Expression/Indication) are purely teleological. They exist only to bridge the gap between Fact and Principle. If the gap closes (Absolute Knowledge), the distinctions vanish. If the gap remains, the distinctions are never pure. Thus, their possibility is formally identical to their impossibility.\n\nFrom this collapse, the analysis moves to the 'Closure.' By contrasting Husserl with Hegel, we see that absolute self-presence (the Voice without différance) is structurally indistinguishable from Death. The 'Living Present,' by striving for absolute purity, necessitates its own erasure. Consequently, the logic sublates the concept of 'Origin.' We no longer trace the Sign back to a lost Presence; rather, we posit a 'Trace' or 'Archi-writing' that is 'older' than the origin itself. Truth is not the father of the sign; the structure of the sign (repetition/death) is the condition of possibility for any truth.",
        "interpretive_notes": "This chunk contains the famous declaration of the 'Closure of Metaphysics.' The logic requires careful handling of 'Infinity': Husserl's 'indefinite' infinity vs. Hegel's 'positive' infinity. Derrida uses Hegel to show that 'Infinite Différance' is actually finite because it is bound to the mortality of the living subject. This collapses the distinction between the Infinite and the Finite, forcing the emergence of the 'Trace'."

Derrida analyzes Husserl's admission that the 'objective expression'—the perfect, univocal language of science—is an infinite ideal, functionally unattainable in fact. This deferral reveals that the essential distinctions of phenomenology (fact/essence, sign/intuition) are teleological structures whose possibility coincides with their factual impossibility. The analysis then pivots to the concept of 'différance,' arguing that infinite différance appears only through the subject's relationship to death. Finally, Derrida declares the 'closure' of the history of metaphysics: the dream of Absolute Knowledge (a voice without différance) is revealed to be indistinguishable from absolute death. The 'trace' or 'supplement' is posited as 'older' than the originary presence it was supposed to follow.",

Initially, the Telos (the goal of objective truth) served as the normative anchor for meaning. However, purely objective expression is now revealed as an 'infinite task'—a deferral rather than a guarantee. This generates a logical aporia where the conditions of possibility for phenomenological distinctions are simultaneously the conditions of their impossibility. \n\nFrom this collapse, a new foundation emerges—not the 'Living Present' as a positive fullness, but 'Finitude' and 'Death.' Derrida sublates the Husserlian 'Life' (Lebendigkeit) into the 'Relation to Death.' The 'Voice,' previously the medium of self-presence, is shown to be suicidal: a voice without difference (pure presence) is identical to silence (pure death). The narrative concludes by inverting the temporal order of metaphysics: the 'Sign' (Trace/Supplement), traditionally seen as a late addition to Reality, is now recognized as 'older' than the Origin itself.",

It signifies that the gap (différance) allowing a concept to function is the same gap that prevents it from ever being fully realized.

In its place emerges a Subjectivity defined by the 'Messianic'—an aiming at a 'Non-Object,' a promise that remains structurally open and incalculable. This movement does not escape Metaphysics by fleeing to a transcendent 'beyond'; rather, it operates within the 'Closure' of the system, finding an 'immanent beyond' (a line of flight) through the reconception of old concepts (paleonymy).",

        "summary": "This section—comprising the endnotes to the text—contextualizes the specific critique of the sign within Derrida's broader philosophical project, linking it to the concepts of violence, desire, and the messianic. The analysis reveals that the hierarchy of Presence over the Sign is not a neutral logical preference but a 'violent' operation driven by a metaphysical desire for propriety and self-proximity. The text contrasts Husserl's concept of Intentionality (which always aims at a determined object) with a deconstructive 'aiming' at a 'non-object' (indetermination/incompleteness). This shift opens the structure of the 'Messianic,' defined not by salvation or teleological fulfillment, but by an uncalculable future that may arrive as a threat. Finally, the analysis situates Derrida's method as 'Paleonymy': the reuse of old metaphysical names ('Metaphysics,' 'Spirit') to designate new, expansive concepts, operating at the 'closure' of the system to point toward an immanent 'beyond.'",
        "conceptual_narrative": "As we examine the subterranean infrastructure of the arguments (the notes), we find the *motivations* behind the logical structures previously analyzed. The dominance of Presence is exposed as a *Desire*—a wish to close the gap between the self and its expression. This desire manifests as *Violence* within the binary oppositions (e.g., Speech over Writing), where one term represses the other. \n\nThe movement of the *Dialectic* here shifts from the *Epistemological* (truth/error) to the *Ethical-Strategic* (violence/closure). Husserl's 'Intentionality' acts as a compressive force, demanding that every thought find its rest in an Object. Derrida counters this with an expansive 'Aiming' that targets the 'Non-Object'—the void or the open question that cannot be filled by presence. This introduces the 'Messianic' structure: a waiting for a future that is structurally incapable of being anticipated or programmed, preserving the radical alterity of what is to come.\n\nSimultaneously, the text addresses the strategy of the 'Paleonym.' We cannot simply step outside metaphysics (which would be another metaphysical move of establishing a pure 'outside'). Instead, we must inhabit the old structures (Closure) and rework their terminology from within, turning 'Metaphysics' against itself to reveal the 'Beyond' that resides not in heaven, but in the fissures of the text.",

It explicitly fragments the concept of 'Being' into various hyphenated semiotic modes (sign-being, indication-being), reinforcing the thesis that ontology is derivative of the sign. The indexical juxtapositions—linking 'Deconstruction' to 'Destruction,' 'Complexity' to 'Complicity,' and 'Closure' to the state of being 'closed in upon itself'—serve as a non-linear recapitulation of the book's central dialectic: the impossibility of a simple, unmediated origin.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "At this terminal stage, the text dissolves into a pure nomenclature, yet this scattering reveals the rigid architecture of the concepts. The entry for 'Being' is particularly revelatory; it is no longer a unitary foundation but is disseminated into 'sign-being,' 'indication-being,' and 'being-nearby-itself.' This confirms the sublation of Classical Ontology into Grammatology: Being is only accessible through the hyphenation of the Sign.\n\nFurthermore, the lexical proximity of 'Complexity' and 'Complicity' serves as a final shorthand for the deconstructive method: to show that the 'Simple' (the origin) is always already 'Complicated' (folded) and 'Complicit' with the metaphysics it claims to exclude. The 'Closure' of history is mapped here as a topology of 'inside closed in upon itself,' confirming that the escape from metaphysics cannot be a simple exit but must be an inhabitation of its closure.",
        "interpretive_notes": "While this text is an index, the selection and grouping of terms act as a meta-commentary. The fragmentation of 'Being' into discursive modes (sign-being, indication-being) is a direct formalization of the claim that 'there is nothing outside the text.' The cross-referencing of 'Deconstruction' with 'Destruction' (Heideggerian Destruktion) acknowledges the genealogy of the method while signaling its distinct operation."

The 'Living Present' is exposed not as a simple origin, but as a complex effect generated by 'Non-Presence'. The 'Monologue', intended to be the sanctuary of pure Meaning, is revealed to be structurally dependent on the very 'Non-Reality' and 'Representation' it sought to exclude. Thus, the Index functions as a testament to the sublation of the 'Proper' into the 'Non-Proper' (Trace).",

        "summary": "This section comprises the first segment of the Index (A-E), acting as a retrospective lexicon of the concepts developed throughout the text. It catalogs the movement from 'Being' and 'Consciousness' to 'Différance' and 'Expression.' The Index functions not merely as a navigational tool but as a compressive archive, flattening the temporal dialectic of the reading into a spatialized, alphabetical simultaneity. It juxtaposes traditionally opposed terms (e.g., 'Death' and 'Declaration,' 'Différance' and 'Demonstration') revealing their systemic complicity.",
        "conceptual_narrative": "The appearance of the Index marks a critical shift in the phenomenological journey: the transformation of the 'Way' (methodos) into the 'Map' (topos). Throughout the preceding analysis, concepts like *Expression*, *Indication*, and *Meaning* were treated as dynamic forces in a struggle for priority. Now, listed alphabetically, they undergo a final *compressive* determination. \n\nThe entry for 'Being' fractures into multiple hyphenated forms (indication-being, sign-being), confirming that ontology in this framework is not a monolithic ground but a textual effect derived from the sign. The proximity of 'Death' and 'Différance' in the list reinforces their theoretical inseparability: the delay of presence (différance) is structurally identical to the finitude of life (death). \n\nFurthermore, the entry for 'Closure' signifies the limit of the metaphysical epoch. The Index itself performs this closure, encircling the vocabulary of phenomenology within a finite set of traces. It demonstrates that the 'Circle' of understanding is not a flaw but a structural necessity; one cannot exit the language of metaphysics, only arrange its terms differently. Thus, the Index represents the 'Objective Whole' of the text, standing in tension with the 'Subjective Process' of reading.",
        "interpretive_notes": "We treat the Index as a 'Conceptual Periodic Table.' The alphabetical ordering disrupts the logical deduction (Subject -> Object -> Synthesis) and replaces it with a textual arbitrariness (B -> C -> D), reflecting the deconstructive insight that the 'Logos' (logical order) is always contaminated by 'Gramma' (textual order). The definitions generated here are therefore 'Canonical Definitions' representing the final state of these concepts in the PML system."
